1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,200
Ten million species live on planet earth. 

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,600
Each one is remarkable. 

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,360
But none can survive on its own. 

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,280
All life depends upon connections. 

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Unexpected, invariably complex, beautiful relationships between millions of plants and animals. 

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,480
This time, in our seasonal forests, 

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,520
why does this lynx need a caterpillar? 

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
Why does the tree need the fish? 

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
And why does this truffle fungus need one of these?! 

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,240
Flying squirrel! 

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,360
Connections like these form the planet's great ecosystems. 

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,360
They're vital for all life. 

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,160
I want to show you our world as you've never seen it before. 

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,800
JAUNTY MUSIC 

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,640
New England in autumn. 

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,040
There really can't be a more magical place anywhere on earth, 

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,480
to appreciate that dramatic transition between summer and winter. 

18
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,400
But we mustn't get blinded by this natural fiesta, 

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,440
because such an extreme transformation is a huge challenge for life. 

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,120
And autumn is just one of many transformations the forest must face. 

21
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,160
From summer to winter, this land of plenty will appear to collapse, 

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,160
before attempting to rebuild itself all over again in the spring. 

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,800
To see how, I'm going to, what is for me, the greatest seasonal forest on the planet. 

24
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,200
The wooded wilderness that stretches right across North America. 

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,440
From the land of the Canadian lynx, 

26
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,080
to the land of the grizzly bear. 

27
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,600
Our story begins in autumn. 

28
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,680
As the days are drawing shorter, less light is feeding the forests. 

29
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
Deciduous trees are shedding their leaves. 

30
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,560
Many creatures are burrowing away to escape the cold. 

31
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,960
Others are simply leaving. 

32
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,120
But there's one animal with a crucial job to do. 

33
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,040
Now, before the winter sets in. 

34
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,200
It's a job the entire forest depends upon. 

35
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,880
The best time to see them is in the first couple of hours after dark. 

36
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,640
And what I'm hoping is, if I stand here and stay really quiet, I'll be in for a real treat. 

37
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,440
It's a creature I've waited all my life to see. 

38
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,200
But they move so fast! 

39
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Oh! Did you see that?! 

40
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,560
That was amazing, it went right past my face! 

41
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Flying squirrel! 

42
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,920
They really are expert gliders. 

43
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,800
They can glide for up to 200 metres! 

44
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,800
When I was a kid, I was obsessed with things that were, you know, not meant to fly. 

45
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,760
Flying fish, flying frogs, flying lizards, flying squirrels. 

46
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,000
This is the first time I've ever seen them. 

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
It was worth a 45-year wait. Honestly! 

48
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,080
Did you... Did you see that?! 

49
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,920
I felt it. It went right through my hair. Seriously! 

50
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,440
Centre parting! 

51
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,800
It was like a sheet of A4 coming right over my face 

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,240
and as soon as they hit the tree they're running and up they go. 

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,600
They're just criss-crossing all the trees. 

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,880
They immediately scamper up to the top, then take off and glide again, 

55
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,640
and sometimes, I've noticed, they can even change direction in flight. 

56
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,400
Arghh! 

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
One hit me in the chest! 

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,880
It doesn't come better than that, does it? 

59
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,000
It doesn't get more exciting. 

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,480
But what on earth have they got to do with our story? 

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,040
Well, at the moment, these flying squirrels are in the woods 

62
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,120
trying to find as much food as possible before the weather turns nasty and the winter kicks in. 

63
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,720
But what are they after? Well, they're after these. 

64
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,400
Truffles. 

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,320
They're the fruiting bodies of fungi and they appear in the damp cool of autumn. 

66
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,800
In preparation for winter, 

67
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,280
the hungry squirrel needs to hoard food such as truffles. 

68
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,920
But the truffles also need the squirrel to eat them. 

69
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,280
As the squirrel moves through the forest, the spores are dispersed. 

70
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,440
And that's crucial, not just for the truffle, but for the trees. 

71
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,240
What's so special about these truffles? 

72
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,800
They certainly don't look much, and the smell can be said to be an acquired taste. 

73
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,600
And they're not just here as another organism to be eaten by hordes of hungry squirrels either, 

74
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,280
because without these truffles, and all the other fungi here in the wood, 

75
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,200
this woodland simply couldn't function. It couldn't exist. 

76
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
Why? 

77
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,920
Well, take a look beneath the soil down here. 

78
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,960
Each truffle has thread-like roots extending from it. 

79
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,000
The threads extract nutrients in the soil, from rotting material like leaves. 

80
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,080
And, cunningly, they also tap into the roots of the trees to siphon off sugars. 

81
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,680
But this is not a one-way relationship, 

82
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,800
because the tree can now tap into the nutrients extracted by the fungal threads. 

83
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,040
This symbiotic relationship between the trees and the fungus, 

84
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,640
where each is dependent on the other, 

85
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,080
clearly helps the tree grow, but it's not only that. 

86
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,160
It greatly extends the reach of its roots 

87
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,600
because, in effect, they become as extensive as the fungal network that they're connected to. 

88
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,000
In autumn, throughout the northern hemisphere, trees use fungi to extend their roots 

89
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,880
and absorb sufficient nutrients for the big freeze ahead. 

90
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,680
I love this web of relationships - the squirrels, the fungi, the trees. 

91
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,080
It ensures that they're all ready to face the winter. 

92
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,560
But for me, one of the most magical relationships of all is seen on the far west coast of Canada, 

93
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,760
as one of the world's most ancient forests 

94
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,720
prepares for the oncoming challenge. 

95
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,040
Here, I can stand at the foot of 1,000-year-old cedars 

96
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,520
and 90-metre-tall Sitka spruce trees. 

97
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,720
The combination of large mountains 

98
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,520
and ocean winds generates unusually heavy rainfall - 

99
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,360
earning this place the title The Raincoast. 

100
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,480
There's so much rain in autumn that the rivers swollen. 

101
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,600
And that is vital to the forest's survival. 

102
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,560
There's a significant event happening here, 

103
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,080
which allows the whole forest not only to survive the winter, 

104
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,240
but also to flourish throughout the course of the year. 

105
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,360
But you know, the really incredible thing is this key to life 

106
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
is not here in the forest at all at the moment, but it will be soon. 

107
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,440
After years at sea, salmon are returning to spawn 

108
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
in the same forest streams in which they were hatched. 

109
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,800
The swollen rivers make it easy for them to swim deep into the forest. 

110
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,480
But the scent of home also draws them irresistibly towards danger. 

111
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,200
Predators make the most of this banquet of seafood. 

112
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,880
But none of them compare to the most formidable fish eater of all. 

113
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,720
Grizzly bears. Just look at this - there's a female here, 

114
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,680
about 40 metres in front of me, in the shallows, fishing for salmon. 

115
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,160
Behind her, on the bar over there, she's got three cubs. 

116
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,760
They're not struggling to catch the fish here. 

117
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
There's such a tremendous surfeit of tired salmon out there. 

118
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,880
All she really has to do is wander into those shallows 

119
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,160
until one comes close. 

120
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,360
And then she can grab it, much to the delight of her cubs. 

121
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,960
For these cubs, it's the first salmon run. 

122
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,960
They've got to learn how to catch fish by watching their mother. 

123
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,000
Look at this! Look! 

124
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,920
This is the adult grizzly, 

125
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,800
that's just leapt off the island there, 

126
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,960
and caught a salmon. Look at that! Right in its mouth. 

127
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Over just six weeks in autumn, 

128
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,280
tens of millions of salmon are going to return to these rivers. 

129
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,000
And during the course of a day 

130
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,960
one adult bear like this can eat 40kg of salmon, 

131
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,480
and during the course of a salmon run 1400kg - 

132
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,160
that's just one bear's intake. 

133
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,320
But every salmon caught by these bears 

134
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,880
increases their chances of survival. 

135
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,840
They are incredibly important to these bears, 

136
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,800
particularly at this time of year, 

137
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,880
when it's essential that they bulk up as quickly as possible 

138
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,160
before they slip into hibernation with the winter coming. 

139
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,960
This cub hasn't quite got the hang of it yet, 

140
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,640
but he hasn't got long - 

141
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,720
the salmon run has only got a couple of weeks to go. 

142
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,240
Until they learn, Mum has to work even harder. 

143
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,120
Every salmon caught makes a real difference. 

144
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,960
These bears, those that are close to a huge amount of salmon, 

145
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,400
grow 80% larger than those in other areas. 

146
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,360
They have 25% more cubs, 

147
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,760
and occur at densities 50 times greater. 

148
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,760
So salmon, frankly, are great news for bears. 

149
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,480
Exciting as it is to watch, 

150
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,200
there's a lot more going on here 

151
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,720
than simply bears catching fish. 

152
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,560
And the reason is thanks to what happens next. 

153
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,440
And the only way to see it is with remote cameras, 

154
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,440
positioned deep in the forest. 

155
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,360
These younger bears have carried fish 30m from the river. 

156
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,960
Because here they are less likely to be challenged by hungry adults. 

157
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,440
So they can eat in peace. 

158
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,240
There's so much fish available, they just eat the richest bits 

159
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,120
to lay down enough fat for hibernation. 

160
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,560
The rest appears to be wasted, abandoned on the forest floor! 

161
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,800
Along with our camera. 

162
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,280
The aftermath of this feast is unbelievable. 

163
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,120
Up to four tonnes of carcasses are left in an area the size 

164
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,680
of a football pitch. 

165
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,240
But what have dead fish 

166
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,760
got to do with the forest preparing for winter? 

167
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,160
Well, this is where it starts to get really intriguing, 

168
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,600
because the catching of the salmon is just the start of it. 

169
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,200
Bears aren't the only creatures 

170
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,320
attracted by such a feast. 

171
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
A banana slug. 

172
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,200
At 25cm long, it's one of the largest slugs in the world. 

173
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,760
And masses of insects. 

174
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,280
These flies won't survive the winter, 

175
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,280
but if they plant their eggs in the salmon's flesh, 

176
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,760
their offspring might. 

177
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,520
This flurry of activity 

178
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,280
eventually breaks the flesh down into simple nutrients 

179
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,960
that are absorbed into the soil. 

180
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,880
The significance of all of this decaying fish 

181
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,680
goes far beyond it being just a feast for scavengers. 

182
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,640
Without all of these rotting salmon accumulating here every autumn, 

183
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,720
this forest would be a very different place. 

184
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,360
The salmon nutrients in the soil are taken up by the fungi. 

185
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,160
So this ancient forest is better equipped to face 

186
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,680
the almighty change that's fast approaching. 

187
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,680
For forests in the Northern Hemisphere, time has run out. 

188
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,440
Every day the sun sinks lower in the sky. 

189
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,680
Winter. 

190
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,960
And on the face of it, 

191
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,680
all of the life here seems to have just gone away. 

192
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,520
Those truffles and the seeds, 

193
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,920
they're locked away underneath all of this snow. 

194
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,280
The salmon run is over. 

195
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
The vegetation... look at it. It appears to have shut down. 

196
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,480
Even the water is in short supply - it's all frozen. 

197
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,720
All of those connections appear to be broken. 

198
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,200
The fungi have reduced their recycling to a bare minimum. 

199
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,240
And the trees they're connected to are producing little in return. 

200
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,200
The deciduous trees pre-empted the winter by shedding their leaves. 

201
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,880
The conifers are slowing down, too. 

202
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,400
The waxy coating on the needles protects their leaves from the cold. 

203
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,960
But not everything here can 

204
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,960
exist in a state of suspended animation. 

205
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,280
Some of the animals have to remain active, 

206
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,800
and surviving in conditions like this isn't easy. 

207
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,600
The icy cold is the cue for the bears 

208
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,520
to leave the forest altogether. 

209
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,760
With the salmon run over, 

210
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,040
they are retreating to their winter dens, up in the mountains. 

211
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,000
They must spend the entire winter living off their fat reserves 

212
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,120
gained by feeding on all of those salmon. 

213
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
The squirrels, 

214
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,640
and other small mammals, must keep activity to a minimum, 

215
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,480
only occasionally venturing out to retrieve their autumn caches. 

216
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,840
The lower the temperature falls, 

217
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,720
the more vulnerable creatures become. 

218
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,920
Winter has been too brutal for this young white-tailed deer, 

219
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,320
but at least it's an opportunity for some nocturnal scavengers. 

220
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,080
A racoon. 

221
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,080
Out of the forest, a fisher - a relative of martens and weasels. 

222
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,840
And it's smart enough to keep this meal to itself! 

223
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,800
But there is more to this lifeless-looking forest 

224
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,160
than just the scavengers. 

225
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,200
For most creatures, winter is a brutal and unforgiving time. 

226
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,720
But others actually thrive in these conditions. 

227
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,640
You see, for animals that are adapted to live in winter, 

228
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,400
this stripped-down forest ecosystem, 

229
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,680
well, it's a wonderland. 

230
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,200
In winter, here, there are beautiful connections, 

231
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,040
between some of the forest's most enchanting characters. 

232
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,720
There is one predator here, 

233
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,080
an incredibly important animal 

234
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,240
that has no intention of avoiding the snow, 

235
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
because, unlike me, it's perfectly adapted to it. 

236
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,480
But it's an enigma, a really, really shy animal, 

237
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,520
one that's difficult to study. 

238
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,760
Having said that, 

239
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,080
scientists have been tracking them through the forest here 

240
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,480
for more than a decade. 

241
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,840
Scientists from the Maine Department of Fisheries and Wildlife 

242
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,560
have set a trap to catch one alive. 

243
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,760
With those distinctly pointed ears, it can only be a Canadian lynx. 

244
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,360
Lynx are the world's most northerly-dwelling cats. 

245
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,400
And this particular lynx is well-known 

246
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,800
to chief scientist Jen Vashon. 

247
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,440
The ear tags are blue with white. 

248
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,360
That indicates it's L1-11. 

249
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,760
He's called L1-11 and was born in May 2004. 

250
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,720
They've discovered that he is just one of hundreds of lynx living here. 

251
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,320
It's too early with everybody right there. 

252
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,360
In fact, there are more lynx living in these Eastern forests 

253
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,240
than anywhere else in North America. 

254
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,560
Now, the fact that L1-11 has lived all of his life 

255
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,120
in this frozen forest 

256
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,200
has to mean that this is a perfect place for a lynx to live. 

257
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,320
But how can a top predator like this 

258
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,480
survive in such a stripped-down environment, 

259
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,520
when there appears to be so little else here? 

260
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,480
The tracks of their prey are everywhere, 

261
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,080
but actually finding one is a real challenge 

262
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,840
because its winter camouflage is perfect. 

263
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,520
It's taken some finding, but it's there - the snowshoe hare! 

264
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,840
You can just make out its beady little black eye, 

265
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,560
and the black tips to its ears. 

266
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,400
And these things form 80% of a lynx's diet. 

267
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,280
But, as you can see, they don't make it easy for that lynx. 

268
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,120
Their camouflage is astonishing. 

269
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
In the summertime they're brown, 

270
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,360
but in the winter they moult through to a white coat. 

271
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,280
But they also use this thick brush. 

272
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,080
It provides them with excellent cover 

273
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,880
to hide from the lynx, also hide from the elements, 

274
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,960
but it's also crucial in keeping them alive, 

275
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,480
because they climb on top of the snow and nibble at 

276
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,200
all of the shoots and the bark growing from all of this brush. 

277
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,520
Look at that! Beautiful, and with those big snowshoe feet, 

278
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,560
it just sort of floats across the surface of the snow. 

279
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,400
But what the snowshoe hare needs most to survive the winter 

280
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,640
is a specific type of vegetation. 

281
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,200
It must be the right height to eat, 

282
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,800
and provide enough cover to hide from all those lynx. 

283
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,120
So, the vegetation, here, must be perfect. 

284
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,040
And the reason that it does grow into this perfect environment, 

285
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,560
well, you could never guess. 

286
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,760
The most beautiful thing about this story 

287
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,440
is that the lynx, the hare, 

288
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,560
patches of cover like this amongst the forest, didn't happen by chance. 

289
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,160
They're all controlled by the most unlikely of creatures, 

290
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,760
a tiny thing, less than the size of one of my fingernails. 

291
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,400
And at the moment it's hiding, 

292
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,440
having burrowed into the bark of one of these trees, 

293
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,680
or perhaps in a crack in a log lying on the forest floor, 

294
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,800
covered with frozen snow. 

295
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,000
But it's there, and it's waiting. 

296
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,880
It's waiting for springtime. 

297
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,360
As the hours of daylight increase and the ground thaws, 

298
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,960
as if by magic, the northern forests change again. 

299
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,720
As new leaves appear, trees start producing sugars, 

300
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,520
and that's good for the fungus in the soil. 

301
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,960
Entwined with the trees' roots, they can siphon off some of these sugars. 

302
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,120
But not everything appears so harmonious. 

303
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,480
In the land of the lynx, 

304
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,440
something extraordinary is happening to the forest. 

305
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,480
These trees may have endured the winter, 

306
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,520
but now it's spring, they're under attack. 

307
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,520
Some are even dying. 

308
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,760
But what's happening here now is vital 

309
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,160
for how this ecosystem functions over the year. 

310
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,280
This defoliation is entirely natural. 

311
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,640
And I might be able to find one of the culprits down here, 

312
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,440
although they're quite tricky to spot. 

313
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,560
They live in these fresh, green shoots. 

314
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,920
Yes, here we are. 

315
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,120
Now, wrapped delicately in these leaves 

316
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,960
is a species that is single-handedly 

317
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,920
influencing the ecology of this entire forest. 

318
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,160
Inside this nest is the caterpillar of the spruce moth. The budworm. 

319
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,440
And it hasn't only wrapped itself up in those leaves 

320
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,000
to hide from predators, 

321
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,200
because it's eating them as well. 

322
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,080
And it doesn't just eat the leaves, 

323
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,520
it also eats the buds, the flowers, and the cones on the tree here. 

324
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,800
Up in the canopy, a tiny budworm caterpillar 

325
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,040
has just emerged from hibernation. 

326
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,960
It's racing to fatten itself up. 

327
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,560
When it's finished on one branch, it releases a strand of silk, 

328
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,680
and abseils down to the next. 

329
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,720
It's a risky business being a juicy, fat caterpillar - 

330
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,320
you're in danger of being spied by all of those birds, 

331
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,280
just back from migration. 

332
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,800
But the caterpillar has a plan - 

333
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,440
it uses its silk 

334
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,760
to weave the needles together and hide in a dense web. 

335
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,200
Now, the springtime assault by these caterpillars 

336
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,760
is bad news for the trees. 

337
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,440
But for other inhabitants of these forests, 

338
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,840
these caterpillars are heroes. 

339
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,840
It's thanks to the behaviour of this species 

340
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,840
that one of North America's most elusive and charismatic predators - 

341
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,320
the Canadian lynx - is enjoying a bit of a renaissance 

342
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,520
in forests like this one. 

343
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,360
But the caterpillar lives all the way up there, in the canopy. 

344
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,720
Whilst the cat with the pointed ears is prowling around down here. 

345
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,520
So, how can a humble insect like this have any impact 

346
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,680
on a formidable thing like that? 

347
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,520
I bet the lynx never even sees the caterpillar 

348
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,720
throughout the course of its life. 

349
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,560
Why does the lynx need the caterpillar? 

350
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,040
The clue is how they affect the lynx's prey on the forest floor. 

351
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,240
For decades, scientists have studied budworm caterpillars, 

352
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,960
and a remarkable pattern has emerged. 

353
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,880
They've discovered 

354
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,720
that the population of caterpillars fluctuates dramatically. 

355
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,280
And at the peak of a cycle 

356
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,160
there can be tens of thousands of budworms in a single tree. 

357
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,200
And this has devastating consequences. 

358
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,600
Whilst these dramatic natural events might be a catastrophe 

359
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,080
for the established trees, for anything trying to grow 

360
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,040
on the forest floor they are an absolute bonus. 

361
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,680
In here, where it's dark, there's very little, 

362
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,080
very poor diversity - just some mosses and a few ferns. 

363
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,760
But as soon as there's a break in the canopy 

364
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,080
and the sunlight can flood in, well, look at the difference. 

365
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,240
Lots of wild flowers, there's a young maple coming through here, 

366
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,360
mountain ash, and, most importantly of all, regenerating spruce and fir. 

367
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,280
The hares essentially need these regenerating conifers as shelter. 

368
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,040
And of course what's good for the hares is also good for the lynx. 

369
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,400
It's such an elegant connection. 

370
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,840
Without the spring emergence of the hungry caterpillars 

371
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
to chew holes in a dense canopy, 

372
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,120
there wouldn't be enough light flooding the forest floor. 

373
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,560
And, with less light down here, there would be less growing 

374
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,040
for our snowshoe hare to forage and to hide in, 

375
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,760
and then there would be nothing for L1-11 

376
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,720
and all of those hundreds of other lynx to eat. 

377
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,280
And that's why the lynx needs the caterpillar. 

378
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,760
And now it's spring, 

379
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,480
there's no better time to see what the future holds 

380
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,000
for the lynx population. 

381
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,800
Wildlife biologist Jen is doing a count. 

382
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,440
She has detected a signal from a radio-collared female. 

383
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,200
There she is. 

384
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,640
But there might be something else here. 

385
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,120
Safe inside her den, a lynx cub. 

386
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,680
He's just a few weeks old. 

387
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,760
His eyes aren't even open. 

388
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,000
Jen must work fast before Mum returns. 

389
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,520
Thanks to the timing of the budworm opening the canopy this spring, 

390
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,720
there's going to be enough prey for these lynx to hunt next winter. 

391
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,160
Far away to the west, The Raincoast forest is coming back to life. 

392
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Thanks to the richness of the autumn salmon run, 

393
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,720
the bears have survived the winter. 

394
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,480
They've now returned to the forest, looking for something to eat. 

395
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,960
They'll survive on vegetation until the next salmon run. 

396
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,520
The emergence of the bears is a cue for scientists

1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,330
A third of the land
on our planet is desert.

2
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:58,678
These great scars
on the face of the Earth

3
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:00,597
appear to be lifeless,

4
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:03,851
but surprisingly none are.

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,571
In all of them life manages somehow

6
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,408
to keep a precarious hold.

7
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,977
Not all deserts are hot.

8
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:43,982
Fifty-mile-an-hour winds
blowing in from Siberia

9
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:48,154
bring snow to the Gobi Desert
in Mongolia.

10
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:17,564
From a summer high
of 50 degrees centigrade

11
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,777
the temperature in midwinter
can drop to minus 40,

12
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:25,991
making this one
of the harshest deserts of all.

13
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,049
Few animals can survive
these extreme changes.

14
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,893
Wild Bactrian camels,

15
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:51,646
one of the rarest mammals
on the planet.

16
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,483
And perhaps the hardiest.

17
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:58,238
Their biggest problem
is the lack of water,

18
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,073
particularly now, in winter,

19
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:03,619
when the little there is
is locked up as ice.

20
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:14,841
Surprisingly, snow here never melts.

21
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,847
The air is just too cold
and too dry for it to do so.

22
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,774
The sun's rays turn it
straight into vapor.

23
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,902
It evaporates.

24
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:42,040
But it is the only source
of water,

25
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:45,169
so Bactrian camels eat it.

26
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,505
Elsewhere in the world

27
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:54,221
a camel at a waterhole can drink
as much as 200 liters during a single visit.

28
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:59,686
Here the strategy is to take little and often.

29
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,230
And with good reason,

30
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:05,109
for filling the stomach
with snow could be fatal.

31
00:04:10,658 --> 00:04:12,702
The camels must limit themselves

32
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:16,790
to the equivalent
of just 10 liters a day.

33
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:36,313
Winter is the time
for breeding.

34
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:45,366
This extraordinary performance
is a male Bactrian camel's way

35
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:48,953
of attracting the attention
of a passing female.

36
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,544
In summer the camels can't stray
far from waterholes.

37
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,382
But now, with mouthfuls
of snow lying everywhere

38
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,887
they can travel widely
in search of mates.

39
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:13,191
Today less than a thousand of these desert
specialists remain in the wild.

40
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:18,822
The Gobi, hostile though it is,
is their last stronghold.

41
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:28,459
There's no other desert
quite like the Gobi,

42
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:31,713
but why is this place a desert?

43
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:36,260
There is one simple
and massive cause -

44
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:37,887
the Himalayas.

45
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:46,606
Clouds blowing from the south
hit this gigantic barrier.

46
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:48,149
As they're forced upwards

47
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,695
so they empty their moisture
on the mountain slopes,

48
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:55,616
leaving little for the land
on the other side.

49
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:04,502
From the space
deserts are very conspicuous.

50
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,844
Dunes of sand hundreds of miles long
streak their surface.

51
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,812
With no cloak of vegetation
to conceal them

52
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:24,609
strange formations are exposed
in the naked rock.

53
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:34,204
Africa's Sahara is
the largest desert of all.

54
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,665
It's the size
of the United States

55
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:41,880
and the biggest source of sand
and dust in the entire world.

56
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:25,223
Sandstorms like these
appear without warning

57
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:30,355
and reduce visibility for days
over areas the size of Britain.

58
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:45,080
Dromedaries, single-humped camels,
take these storms in their stride.

59
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:52,756
The heaviest sand rises only
a few meters above the ground,

60
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:58,305
but the dust can be blown
5,000 meters up into the sky.

61
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:07,274
The ferocious wind,
armed with grains of sand,

62
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,237
is the agent that shapes all deserts.

63
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:27,339
Reptiles have armored scaly skins
that protect them from the stinging grains.

64
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:34,556
For insects the bombardment
can be very severe indeed.

65
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:39,604
The only escape
is below the surface.

66
00:08:56,624 --> 00:09:00,838
As the winds rise and fall, swallow and eddy

67
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:04,509
so they pile the sand into dunes.

68
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,351
These sand scenes can be
hundreds of miles across.

69
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:21,529
In Namibia the winds have built
some of the biggest dunes in the world.

70
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:33,502
Star dunes like these
can be 300 meters high.

71
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:38,424
Grains, swept up the flanks,
are blown off the crests of the ridges

72
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:41,261
so it's only the tops
that are moving.

73
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:54,485
The main body of these dunes
may not have shifted for 5,000 years.

74
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:12,298
Few rocks can resist the continuous
blast of the sand carrying wind.

75
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:17,429
These outcrops are standing
in Egypt's White Desert.

76
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,767
But they will not do so
for much longer.

77
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,771
They're being inexorably
chiseled away

78
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:27,942
and turned into more sand.

79
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:14,581
Now lumps of heavily eroded rocks
have been marooned in a sea of sand.

80
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,231
These jagged pyramids
a hundred meters tall

81
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:38,985
were once part
of a continuous rocky plateau.

82
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,741
The blasting sand will eventually
eliminate them altogether.

83
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:58,550
The relentless power of the wind ensures
that the face of a desert is continually changing.

84
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,054
But there is one constant presence -

85
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,774
the desert sun.

86
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:30,004
The sun's heat and power
to evaporate water

87
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:36,304
has had a profound effect on the bodies
and habits of everything that lives here.

88
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:43,604
This sun potentially is a killer.

89
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:49,027
And the red kangaroos
must acknowledge that.

90
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,406
Right now, while the sun is low,

91
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:55,785
there's no immediate cause
for concern.

92
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:59,581
But this situation won't last long.

93
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:06,882
Australia is the world's most arid continent
with blistering daytime temperatures.

94
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:19,939
Every hour the temperature rises
by five degrees centigrade.

95
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,952
Soon the heat will reach
a critical point.

96
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:46,638
Any kangaroo out in the open
is in serious danger of overheating.

97
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:58,527
In the full sun the temperature
on the ground soars to 70 degrees.

98
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:08,539
By midday the radiation is
so intense they must take shelter.

99
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:32,526
In the shade they're shielded
from much of the sun's energy

100
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,613
but their body temperature
can still rise.

101
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:41,995
So they lick saliva
on to their forearms

102
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,167
where there is a network of blood vessels
close to the surface of the skin

103
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:50,965
and, as the saliva evaporates,
their blood is cooled.

104
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:58,390
This thermal image shows
just how effective the process is.

105
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:02,603
The blue areas on the body
are the cooler parts.

106
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:15,202
As the saliva dries
it has to be replaced

107
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:19,624
and this is a real drain
on the kangaroo's body fluids.

108
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:33,933
Even in the shade
the earth is baking hot

109
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:38,062
so the kangaroos dig away
the warmed topsoil

110
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,400
to get at the cooler ground beneath.

111
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:08,641
By staying in the shade and licking
to control their body temperature

112
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:11,978
kangaroos manage to get
through the hottest part of the day

113
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,730
without heat stroke.

114
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,234
But for the majority
of desert animals

115
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:20,822
this strategy would not be
enough for survival.

116
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:48,981
The extraordinary ears
of the fennec foxes of Africa radiate heat

117
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:52,568
but the animals have
another way of keeping cool.

118
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:04,583
They spend their days underground

119
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,753
and only emerge at sunset.

120
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:23,188
Darkness brings huge changes.

121
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:28,236
In the Sahara the temperature can drop
as much as 30 degrees during the night,

122
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:33,117
so it's cool enough to allow
these desert fox cubs to play.

123
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,379
All sorts of creatures now appear

124
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:46,758
including some really unexpected ones.

125
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,014
Toads have permeable skins

126
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:56,102
and would quickly die from desiccation
out in the daytime heat.

127
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:58,814
It's only now that
they can leave shelter.

128
00:18:01,818 --> 00:18:03,778
The same is true for scorpions,

129
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,533
even though their shells
are actually watertight.

130
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:23,594
In fact, most small desert
creatures are nocturnal.

131
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,930
So it's only now
that you can judge

132
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:29,309
just how much life
there can be in the desert.

133
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:36,025
But moisture, lost even at night,
has to be replaced sometime somehow

134
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,823
and that problem dominates
the lives of all desert dwellers.

135
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,377
The Atacama in Chile.

136
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,006
This is the driest desert
in the world.

137
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:59,678
Some parts may not see rain
for fifty years

138
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:01,139
and with such a record

139
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:05,060
you'd expect the place
to be completely barren.

140
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:14,404
These are South America's camels,
guanacos.

141
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:18,201
They're very good
at conserving moisture

142
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:21,705
but they nonetheless
need a regular supply of water.

143
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,016
They get it partly
from cactus flowers

144
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:41,770
but that explanation
raises another question.

145
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:47,611
How do the cacti
survive without rain?

146
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:59,750
Hot winds suck all the moisture
from the surface of the land.

147
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:06,258
Clearly there must be something else
that takes the place of rain.

148
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,600
The secret is a cold sea current
that runs parallel to the land.

149
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:34,000
The cold water cools
the moist warm air above it

150
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,170
and that produces banks of fog.

151
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:07,581
At the same time wind blowing
on to the shore sweeps the fog inland.

152
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:27,230
Before long the cacti
are dripping with dew.

153
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,742
The fog is so regular

154
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:41,455
that moisture loving lichens
are able to grow on the cacti

155
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,918
and they absorb liquid
like a sponge.

156
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:50,132
In the land of almost no rain

157
00:21:50,257 --> 00:21:56,056
these precious drops are life-savers
for many different creatures.

158
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,615
Further inland the air remains so warm
that its moisture does not condense

159
00:22:10,698 --> 00:22:15,371
so this slender strip of desert
is virtually the only part of the Atacama

160
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:17,540
where life can exist.

161
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:23,631
Without the fog,

162
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:26,592
this land, too, would be empty.

163
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,529
The guanacos make
the most of the dew

164
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,491
but it will not remain
for long.

165
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,121
In an hour or two
the sun will have burnt it off

166
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:52,832
and dry the surface of the cacti.

167
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:07,224
The Sonoran desert in Arizona
is not quite so dry as the Atacama -

168
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,561
some rain does fall.

169
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,105
But it is infrequent

170
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:13,690
and when it does arrive

171
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:17,654
animals and plants have
to be ready to make the most of it.

172
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:20,866
And it's coming.

173
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,712
When the summer monsoon blows in

174
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:35,383
the giant saguaros,
one of the biggest of all cacti,

175
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:38,220
are ready to take
full advantage of it.

176
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:19,144
After a rainstorm the saguaro's long shallow
root system sucks up the water

177
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:24,317
and the pleats on its trunk
enable it to expand rapidly.

178
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:37,666
When full, a saguaro stem can store
up to five tons of water

179
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:42,296
and that's enough to see it
through many months of drought.

180
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:52,225
The trunks of these huge plants
provide homes for the gila woodpecker.

181
00:24:54,269 --> 00:25:00,944
But birds are not the only animals
to benefit from the presence of the cacti.

182
00:25:17,297 --> 00:25:19,257
During four weeks of the summer

183
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:25,056
the saguaros bloom at night
to attract visitors.

184
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,355
The pollen and nectar
with which these flowers are loaded

185
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,777
attract long-nosed and long-tongued bats.

186
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:56,176
The bats left Mexico a few days earlier
to escape the heat of summer

187
00:25:56,301 --> 00:26:00,557
and are on their way north
to the southern United States.

188
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:06,522
To get there, they have
to cross the Sonoran desert.

189
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,448
But the desert is so big

190
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,203
that for most of the year
they would be unable to cross it.

191
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,706
Now, with the saguaro in bloom,

192
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,626
they can refuel on the way.

193
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:37,476
So the saguaro's success
in developing a way to store water

194
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:45,402
is now crucial to most of the animals
that live or even travel through this land.

195
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:28,912
The scarcity of rain determined
the shape of this icon of the desert

196
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:31,081
but water, scarce thought it is,

197
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:35,378
has also, like the wind,
shaped the land itself.

198
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:54,443
In the deserts of Utah

199
00:27:54,568 --> 00:28:00,283
ancient rivers flowing across sandstone country
steadily widen their canyons

200
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:06,833
until now the land between them
has been reduced to spires and pinnacles.

201
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:41,708
With little or no soil to retain
the water on the surface of the land

202
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,961
life here is scarce indeed.

203
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:48,632
And when resources are limited,

204
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:51,344
conflict is never far away.

205
00:29:01,982 --> 00:29:04,693
These are Nubian ibex

206
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:07,613
and they are squaring up
for a duel.

207
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:15,331
And when trouble starts,

208
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:20,963
a smart ibex knows that the best thing
to do is to gain higher ground.

209
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:41,612
These are actually
subordinate male ibex,

210
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,241
but their fights
are nonetheless serious.

211
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:49,580
Losing one might mean
never getting the chance to breed ever.

212
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,486
When competitors are evenly
matched as they are here,

213
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:18,615
duels can last for an hour.

214
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:42,769
In this heat the effort
is truly exhausting.

215
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:51,112
But victory here will gain important
ranking points on a male's way to the top.

216
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,068
There's so much at stake

217
00:31:24,193 --> 00:31:26,488
that not all play fair.

218
00:31:41,756 --> 00:31:44,176
The battle has produced the winner,

219
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:48,347
but the ultimate prize
is not his yet.

220
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,107
That currently belongs
to the dominant male ibex.

221
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:02,364
His rank earns him the loyalty
of a harem of females

222
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:06,119
and they follow him closely
as he travels across this desert

223
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:08,413
searching for food and water.

224
00:32:10,582 --> 00:32:13,669
He doesn't have to waste time
looking for mates -

225
00:32:13,794 --> 00:32:15,380
they're his for the taking,

226
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:20,386
so he can concentrate with them
on keeping fit and healthy.

227
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:38,824
Lizards are desert specialists.

228
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:45,749
But here, their numbers
are extraordinary.

229
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:57,430
These crevices in South Africa contain
the highest density of lizards in the world.

230
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:10,946
They're called flat lizards
for obvious reasons,

231
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:16,077
and they flaunt their multi-colored
bellies in territorial disputes.

232
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,040
He's made his point,

233
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,086
and now it's time
to find some food.

234
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,465
As the day warms up,

235
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,842
the lizards move away
from their cracks

236
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,637
and head down
to the bottom of the gorge.

237
00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:35,100
Their goal is the river.

238
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,939
There is no food at the edge,

239
00:33:40,064 --> 00:33:43,777
but this desert river
holds a secret.

240
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:55,833
Each day blackfly rise
from turbulent stretches of the river.

241
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,795
This is what the lizards
have come for.

242
00:34:13,938 --> 00:34:16,066
The black fly never land,

243
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:19,862
so the lizards have to leap
for their food.

244
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:38,551
In one day each of these acrobatic
little lizards may catch 50 flies.

245
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,066
There are plenty of flies
to go round,

246
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:54,653
even with hundreds of lizards
competing for them.

247
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:14,802
Away from these rapids flat lizard populations
are found in much smaller numbers.

248
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:19,934
But here one unusual abundance
has produced another.

249
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:33,992
Deserts are created by the lack of water,

250
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:38,414
but what actually kills animals
here is not heat or thirst,

251
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,500
but lack of food.

252
00:35:58,938 --> 00:36:03,068
So how on earth does
a plant-eater this size

253
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:08,992
survive in a place apparently
totally devoid of vegetation?

254
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,380
Elephants in Namibia
are the toughest in Africa.

255
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:21,465
And they need to be.

256
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,823
What little food exists
is so dispersed

257
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:44,994
that these elephants walk
up to 50 miles a day

258
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,876
as they travel up the dry river channels
searching for something to eat.

259
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,815
At times the task
looks truly helpless.

260
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:48,319
Elephants may seem out of place
in this landscape,

261
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:51,114
but they're not the only ones.

262
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:11,305
Amazingly, lions live here, too.

263
00:38:15,852 --> 00:38:19,940
In savannah country huge herds
of games support prides

264
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,652
containing 20 lions or more.

265
00:38:22,777 --> 00:38:26,657
But to live here
lions have had to change their habits -

266
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,492
prides are much smaller

267
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:31,663
and their home ranges
are very much bigger.

268
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:35,125
And there's an added problem -

269
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,048
their food is always on the move.

270
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:50,101
Like the elephants,

271
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:55,191
the lions must travel great distances
to find enough to live on.

272
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:13,212
But lions can't go everywhere -

273
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:17,676
they won't attempt to cross
this field of sand dunes

274
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,720
and the oryx know it.

275
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,755
The lions must wait for the oryx
to leave the safety of the dunes,

276
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,842
which eventually they must
to find food and water.

277
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:29,428
And then the lions
will ambush them.

278
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:39,637
The elephants have found
some of their favorite food.

279
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:49,274
Grasses are the staple diet
of all elephants,

280
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:52,778
but this herd concentrates
on digging up the roots,

281
00:41:52,903 --> 00:41:57,033
which have more nutrition
and moisture than the stems.

282
00:41:57,158 --> 00:41:58,577
It's the sort of behavior

283
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:02,915
that can make all the difference
in a place of serious shortages.

284
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:07,421
Yet all this can change
in an instant.

285
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:29,363
The fortunes of many deserts
are ruled by distant rains.

286
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:34,870
This water fell as rain
in mountains more than a hundred miles away.

287
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:42,254
It's known as a flash flood

288
00:42:42,379 --> 00:42:46,718
and called that because the water
may run for just a single day.

289
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:51,557
It's an event that only happens
once or twice a year at the most.

290
00:43:12,373 --> 00:43:16,795
The sandy riverbed acts like
a giant strip of blotting paper

291
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,216
sucking up the water
as soon as it appears.

292
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:33,190
But every square meter of soil
moistened by this river

293
00:43:33,315 --> 00:43:37,820
will increase the chances
of survival for those that live here.

294
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:46,831
Waterholes are filled
temporarily.

295
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:55,008
Elsewhere in Africa
elephants drink every day,

296
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,676
but the lack of water here

297
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:03,518
means that desert elephants can only
refill their tanks once every four or five days.

298
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:08,941
Within a week the flash flood
has produced a flush of green,

299
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:13,363
more than enough to draw
the oryx out of the dunes.

300
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,328
It's a rare chance for them
to build up their food reserves.

301
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:32,511
The flood has made life easier
for the lions, too.

302
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:39,978
The flesh of this oryx will keep
the family going for a week at the most.

303
00:44:40,103 --> 00:44:42,564
But for a while
the hunting will be easier,

304
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,818
now that river channel
has turned green.

305
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:52,618
The good times
for lions and oryx are brief,

306
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:54,787
but these are the short moments

307
00:44:54,912 --> 00:44:59,042
that make it possible to live
in deserts the year round.

308
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:07,886
Death Valley is the hottest
place on Earth.

309
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:12,267
Yet even this furnace
can be transformed by water.

310
00:45:22,863 --> 00:45:27,910
A single shower can enable seeds
that have lain dormant for 30 years or more

311
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:30,163
to burst into life.

312
00:45:38,548 --> 00:45:42,970
And there hasn't been a bloom
like this one for a century.

313
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:58,864
The periods of boom
in Death Valley are short.

314
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:03,244
But they're just frequent enough
to keep life ticking over.

315
00:46:11,796 --> 00:46:16,427
A sudden flush of vegetation is
what every desert dweller waits for,

316
00:46:16,552 --> 00:46:19,847
and when it happens
they must make the most of it.

317
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,666
There is no other species
on the planet

318
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:49,758
that responds as quickly and as dramatically
to the good times as the desert locust.

319
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:55,223
Eggs that have remained in the ground
for 20 years begin to hatch.

320
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:09,991
The young locusts
are known as hoppers,

321
00:47:10,116 --> 00:47:12,452
for at this stage
they're flightless.

322
00:47:12,702 --> 00:47:19,293
They find new feeding grounds
by following the smell of sprouting grass.

323
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:29,097
Normally it takes four weeks
for hoppers to become adults,

324
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:31,725
but when the conditions
are right as now

325
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,605
their development switches
to the fast track.

326
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:43,823
As the vegetation in one place
begins to run out

327
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:47,494
the winged adults release pheromones -
scent messages,

328
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:51,165
which tell others in the group
that they must move on.

329
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:04,723
And when groups merge,

330
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,101
they form a swarm.

331
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:33,841
An adult locust eats
its entire body weight every day,

332
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:39,514
and a whole swarm can consume
literally hundreds of tons of vegetation.

333
00:48:41,058 --> 00:48:43,352
They have to keep on moving.

334
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:47,023
The swarm travels
with the wind -

335
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:50,527
it's the most energy-saving
way of flying.

336
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:59,663
Following the flow of wind means that they're
always heading toward areas of low pressure,

337
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:05,170
places where wind meets rain
and vegetation starts to grow.

338
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:08,090
As they fly,

339
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:10,885
swarms join up with other swarms

340
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,973
to form gigantÂ­Â­Â­ic plagues
several billions strong

341
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:17,643
and as much as 40 miles wide.

342
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:24,276
They will consume every edible thing
that lies in their path.

343
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:41,797
This is one of planet Earth's
greatest spectacles.

344
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:43,883
It's rarely seen on this scale

345
00:49:44,008 --> 00:49:46,052
and it won't last long.

346
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:47,846
Once the food is gone,

347
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:53,895
the steady roar of a billion beating
locust wings will once again be replaced

348
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,692
by nothing more
than the sound of the desert wind.

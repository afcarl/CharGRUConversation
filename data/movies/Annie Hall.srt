1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,979
There's an old joke. Two elderly women
are at a Catskill Mountain resort.

2
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,566
One of 'em says, "The food
at this place is really terrible."

3
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:09,236
The other one says,
"Yeah, I know. And such small portions."

4
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,947
That's essentially
how I feel about life.

5
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:15,993
Full of loneliness and misery
and suffering and unhappiness.

6
00:01:15,994 --> 00:01:18,328
And it's all over much too quickly.

7
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:23,329
The other important joke for me is one
that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx.

8
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,422
I think it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious.

9
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:32,926
It goes like this - I'm paraphrasing.
I would never wanna belong to any club...

10
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,762
...that would have
someone like me for a member.

11
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:40,225
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

12
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,979
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind.

13
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,649
Cos I turned 40, and I guess
I'm going through a life crisis.

14
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,820
I'm not worried about ageing.
Although I'm balding slightly on top.

15
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,531
That's about the worst
you can say about me.

16
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,950
I think I'm gonna get better as I get older.

17
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:59,703
I think I'm gonna be
the balding virile type...

18
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:03,665
...as opposed to, say,
the distinguished grey, for instance.

19
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:08,128
Unless I'm one of those guys with
saliva dribbling out of his mouth...

20
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,381
...who wanders into a cafeteria
with a shopping bag...

21
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,550
...screaming about socialism.

22
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:17,513
Annie and I broke up.
And I still can't get my mind around that.

23
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:21,725
I keep sifting the pieces of
the relationship through my mind...

24
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:26,563
...examining my life, and trying to
figure out - where did the screwup come?

25
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:29,441
A year ago we were... in love, you know.

26
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:34,442
And... It's funny... I'm not a morose type.
I'm not a depressive character.

27
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:36,323
I... I, uh... You know...

28
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,825
I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.

29
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,746
I was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War ll.

30
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:46,583
He's been depressed.
All of a sudden he can't do anything.

31
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,962
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?
- Tell Dr Flicker.

32
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:52,130
It's something he read.

33
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,216
Something he read, uh?

34
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:57,844
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

35
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:02,724
The universe is everything. If it's
expanding, someday it will break apart...

36
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,269
...and that will be the end of everything.

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,437
What is that your business?

38
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,606
He stopped doing his homework.

39
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:13,443
- What's the point?
- What has the universe got to do with it?

40
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,905
You're here in Brooklyn!
Brooklyn is not expanding!

41
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:20,617
It won't be expanding
for billions of years yet, Alvy.

42
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:24,663
And we've gotta try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here, uh?

43
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:29,664
Uh? Uh? (laughs)

44
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,672
My analyst says I exaggerate
my childhood memories.

45
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,592
But I was brought up
under the roller coaster...

46
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:39,219
...in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.

47
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,265
Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.

48
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,642
I have a hyperactive imagination.

49
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:48,186
My mind tends to jump around a little.

50
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,607
I have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

51
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,318
My father ran the bumper car concession.

52
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,819
There he is.

53
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,321
And there I am.

54
00:03:57,322 --> 00:04:02,322
I used to get my aggression out
through those cars all the time.

55
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,204
I remember the staff at our public school.

56
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,333
We had a saying:
"Those who can't do, teach...

57
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,044
...and those who can't teach, teach gym."

58
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:17,045
And those who couldn't do anything,
I think, were assigned to our school.

59
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:22,679
I always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,390
Melvyn Greenglass. His fat little face.

61
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:29,019
And Henrietta Farrell.
Just Miss Perfect all the time.

62
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,481
And Ivan Ackerman.
Always the wrong answer. Always.

63
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,400
Seven and three is nine.

64
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,903
Even then, I knew they were just jerks.

65
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:42,904
In 1942 I had already discovered women.

66
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,160
Ugh! He kissed me!

67
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,037
He kissed me! Ugh!

68
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,916
That's the second time this month!
Step up here! Step up here!

69
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,919
- What did I do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

70
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,297
Why? I was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

71
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,842
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

72
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:01,968
I did.

73
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,972
For God's sakes, Alvy!
Even Freud speaks of a latency period.

74
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:09,309
Well, I never had a latency period.
I can't help it.

75
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,106
Why couldn't you have been more like
Donald? Now there was a model boy.

76
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,608
Tell the folks where you are today.

77
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:20,028
I run a profitable dress company.

78
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,740
Sometimes I wonder
where my classmates are today.

79
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:28,620
I'm president of
the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

80
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,789
I sell tallises.

81
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,790
I used to be a heroin addict.
Now I'm a methadone addict.

82
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,173
I'm into leather.

83
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:44,302
I lost track of most of my schoolmates,
but I wound up a comedian.

84
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:49,303
They did not take me in the army.
I was... Interestingly enough... I was 4-P.

85
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,686
In the event of war, I'm a hostage.

86
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,688
(laughter)

87
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,315
You always only saw the worst in people.

88
00:05:57,316 --> 00:06:00,444
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

89
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,155
You were always out of step
with the world.

90
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:06,867
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

91
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:10,454
(Alvy) I distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

92
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:11,830
(Rob) You're crazy.

93
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:15,500
(Alvy) We were walking off
the tennis court. Him and me and his wife.

94
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,921
He looked at her and they both looked at
me. And under his breath he said, "Jew."

95
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,090
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.

96
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,676
(Alvy) I pick up on those kinda things.

97
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:29,264
I was having lunch with some guys from
NBC. So I said, "Did you eat yet or what?"

98
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,683
And Tom Christie said, "No. D'you?"

99
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,186
Not "Did you". "D'you eat?" "D'you?"

100
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:37,773
Not "Did you eat?" but "D'you eat?"
"Jew?" You get it? "Jew eat?"

101
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,900
- Max...
- Stop calling me Max.

102
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:44,821
Why, Max? It's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

103
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:49,822
(Alvy) I was in a record store. There's
this big, tall, blond, crew-cutted guy...

104
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:55,203
...looking at me in a funny way and saying,
"We have a sale this week on Wagner."

105
00:06:55,208 --> 00:07:00,208
Wagner, Max. Wagner. I know what he's
really trying to tell me, very significantly.

106
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,714
Right, Max.

107
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,758
California, Max.

108
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,844
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

109
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,972
We move to sunny LA.
All of show business is there.

110
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:15,227
No. I don't wanna live in a city
where the only cultural advantage...

111
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:18,230
...is that you can make
a right turn on a red light.

112
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,149
Forget it.
Aren't you late for meeting Annie?

113
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,150
I'm meeting her at the Beekman.
I have a few minutes.

114
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:44,422
Are you on television?

115
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,467
No.

116
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,761
Yeah. Once in a while. Occasionally.

117
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:53,807
- What's your name?
- You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter.

118
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:57,811
You were on the... uh...
The Johnny Carson, right?

119
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,980
Once in a while, you know.

120
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,148
What's your name?

121
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,568
I'm... I'm Robert Redford.

122
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,736
Come on!

123
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,407
Alvy Singer. It was nice...
Thanks very much for everything.

124
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,867
Hey!

125
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,535
(man) What?

126
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,620
This is Alvy Singer!

127
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,581
Fellas, you know...

128
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:20,625
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer? Am I right?

129
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,336
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

130
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,505
I need a large polo mallet.

131
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:28,675
- Who's on television?
- On The Johnny Carson Show.

132
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,844
Is this a meeting of the Teamsters?

133
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,680
- What programme?
- Can I have your autograph?

134
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:37,559
- You don't want my autograph.
- No, I do. It's for my girlfriend.

135
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,728
Make it out to Ralph.

136
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,729
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- It's for my brudder.

137
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,487
- Alvy Singer!
- You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star?

138
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,656
Alvy Singer over here!

139
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,825
It's all right, fellas.

140
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:57,162
Jesus! What did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

141
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:00,498
- I'm in a bad mood.
- I'm here with the cast of The Godfather.

142
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,794
- You have to learn to deal with it.
- I'm dealing with guys named Cheech!

143
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,172
Please. I have a headache, all right?

144
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:10,300
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

145
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:15,138
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think I'm getting my period!

146
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,433
A little louder. I think
one of them may have missed it.

147
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:21,645
- Has the picture started?
- It started two minutes ago.

148
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,939
That's it. Forget it. I can't go in.

149
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,442
- Two minutes, Alvy.
- I can't do it. We've blown it already.

150
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,611
I can't go in in the middle.

151
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:32,405
We'll only miss the titles.
They're in Swedish.

152
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:36,117
- You wanna get coffee for two hours?
- Two hours? No. I'm going in.

153
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,955
- Go ahead. Goodbye.
- While we're talking, we could be inside.

154
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:44,250
Can we not stand here and argue
in front of everybody? I get embarrassed.

155
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,419
All right. So what do you wanna do?

156
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,089
I don't know now.
You wanna go to another movie?

157
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,257
Let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

158
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,095
Come on. I'm not in the mood to see
a four-hour documentary on Nazis.

159
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:59,516
Well, I'm sorry. I've gotta see a picture
exactly from the start to the finish.

160
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,601
Cos... Cos I'm anal.

161
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:06,231
That's a polite word for what you are.

162
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:10,276
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
It is not one of his best.

163
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,445
It lacks a cohesive structure.

164
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:17,283
You get the feeling that he's not
absolutely sure what it is he wants to say.

165
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:21,246
I've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

166
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:25,917
Granted, La Strada was a great film.
Great in its use of negative imagery.

167
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:28,920
I can't stand this guy.
I'm gonna have a stroke.

168
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,089
Well, stop listening to him.

169
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,591
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

170
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:37,762
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits
or Satyricon.

171
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,265
I found it incredibly... indulgent.

172
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:44,019
He really is. He's one of
the most indulgent filmmakers.

173
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,187
The key word here is indulgent.

174
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,148
Without getting...

175
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,402
- What are you depressed about?
- I missed my therapy. I overslept.

176
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,739
- How can you possibly oversleep?
- The alarm clock.

177
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,742
Do you know
what a hostile gesture that is to me?

178
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,453
I know.
Because of our sexual problem, right?

179
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:05,248
Everybody at The New Yorker
has to know our rate of intercourse?

180
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,208
It's like Samuel Beckett.

181
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,962
I admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

182
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:14,382
- I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
- Stop it, Alvy!

183
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:18,011
He's spitting on my neck.
He's spitting on my neck when he talks.

184
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,639
You know, you're so egocentric
that if I miss my therapy...

185
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,976
...you can only think of it
in terms of how it affects you.

186
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,145
Weltanschauung is what it is.

187
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,314
Probably on their first date.

188
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:32,859
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

189
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,487
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

190
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:38,698
...who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy."

191
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,536
Our sexual problem? I'm comparatively
normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

192
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:47,791
OK. I'm very sorry. My sexual problem.
OK? My sexual problem. Huh?

193
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:52,295
I never read that. That was a Henry James
novel? Sequel of The Turn of the Screw?

194
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,631
It's the influence of television.

195
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:58,927
Now, Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high...

196
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:02,347
...high intensity.
You understand? A hot medium...

197
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:06,309
What I wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

198
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,730
What do you do when you get stuck in
a movie line with a guy like this behind?

199
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,900
Why can't I give my opinion?
It's a free country.

200
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:18,822
Do you have to give it so loud? Aren't
you ashamed to pontificate like that?

201
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:23,201
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

202
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:27,997
Really? I happen to teach a class
at Columbia called TV, Media and Culture.

203
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:32,335
So I think my insights into Mr McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

204
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:37,006
Oh, do you? That's funny, because
I happen to have Mr McLuhan right here.

205
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,509
Just let me... Come over here a second.

206
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,678
I heard what you were saying.

207
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,847
You know nothing of my work.

208
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:46,182
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

209
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,478
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing.

210
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:55,479
Boy, if life were only like this!

211
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,405
June 14th, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.

212
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:05,201
All over the country, people are desperate
for every available scrap of news.

213
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,788
(Alvy) Those guys in the French
Resistance were really brave.

214
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,000
To have to listen to
Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

215
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:15,420
Sometimes I ask myself
how I'd stand up under torture.

216
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:19,549
The Gestapo would take away
your Bloomingdale's charge card...

217
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,718
...and you'd tell 'em everything.

218
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,887
That movie makes me feel guilty.

219
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,056
Yeah, cos it's supposed to.

220
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,266
ANY...

221
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,602
What? What... What's the matter?

222
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,770
I don't... I don't know.

223
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:37,771
It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed
together. You know, it's been a long time.

224
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:43,072
Well, it's just that I gotta sing tomorrow
night, so I have to rest my voice.

225
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,451
There's always an excuse.
You used to think I was very sexy.

226
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:49,579
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

227
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,707
We're probably
in the Guinness Book of World Records.

228
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,336
Alvy, it'll pass.
I'm going through a phase. That's all.

229
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:59,547
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

230
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,091
You were very hot for Allison at first.

231
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,637
(audience laughter)

232
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:09,974
You're on right after Chris Brown,
which looks about 20 minutes.

233
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,143
Excuse me. When do I go on?

234
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,312
Who are you?

235
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,481
Alvy Singer.

236
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,024
I'm a comedian.

237
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,525
Oh, comedian. Yeah.

238
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,694
Oh. You're on next.

239
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,863
What do you mean, next? I'm...

240
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,032
You're on right after this act.

241
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,534
No, it can't be. Because he's a comic.

242
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,661
Yes.

243
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:32,872
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

244
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,459
No, I'm sorry. I don't wanna go on
after another comedian.

245
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,585
It's OK.

246
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:40,755
No. Because they're laughing.
So I'd... rather not.

247
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,299
Will you relax? They're gonna love you.

248
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,427
I'd prefer not to. Look.
They're laughing at him.

249
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,305
They're gonna laugh at him
then I gotta go out.

250
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,267
I gotta get laughs too.
How much can they laugh?

251
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:55,144
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

252
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,064
Jesus!

253
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,649
What's your name?

254
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,359
Allison.

255
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,610
Yeah?

256
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:03,861
Allison what?

257
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,697
Portchnik.

258
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,699
Portchnik?

259
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,867
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

260
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,578
Allison Portchnik! (whistles)

261
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,041
So, what are you telling me? You work
for Stevenson all the time or what?

262
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,961
No,no,no.
I'm in the midst of doing my thesis.

263
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,254
On what?

264
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,549
Political Commitment
in 20th-Century Literature.

265
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,594
You're like... New York, Jewish,
left-wing, liberal, intellectual...

266
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,598
...Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps?

267
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,769
The father with the Ben Shahn drawings?
The really strike-oriented...

268
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,148
Stop me before I make
a complete imbecile of myself.

269
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,694
No. That was wonderful. I love
being reduced to a cultural stereotype.

270
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,905
Right. I'm a bigot. But for the Left.

271
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,116
(laughter and applause)

272
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:54,078
I have to go out there.
Say something encouraging. Quickly.

273
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,205
I think you're cute.

274
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,374
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

275
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:03,375
Go ahead.

276
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,261
(coughs)

277
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:14,307
I don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally cos...

278
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,894
...I'm not essentially
a political comedian at all.

279
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:22,607
I interestingly had, um... dated a woman...

280
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,735
...in the Eisenhower administration briefly.

281
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,780
And it was ironic to me cos, um...

282
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,240
Cos I was trying to do to her...

283
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:35,870
...what Eisenhower has been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

284
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,665
(laughter and applause)

285
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,126
I'm sorry. I can't go through with this.

286
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,463
I can't get it off my mind, Allison.
It's obsessing me.

287
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,383
I'm getting tired of it.
I need your attention.

288
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:52,595
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository...

289
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:56,391
...and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

290
00:16:56,392 --> 00:17:00,728
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

291
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,815
- It doesn't make sense!
- Alvy...

292
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:07,235
I'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough...

293
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:09,821
...to hit a moving target at that range.

294
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:11,781
But...

295
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,200
...if there was a second assassin...

296
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,786
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

297
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,664
They recovered the shells from that rifle.

298
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,833
OK. What are you saying now?

299
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:26,337
Everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

300
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,797
Well, why not?

301
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,215
Yeah. Earl Warren?

302
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,717
Hey, honey. I don't know Earl Warren.

303
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,886
Lyndon Johnson?

304
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:38,391
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!
You know the ethics those guys have.

305
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:41,436
It's like a notch
underneath child molester.

306
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:44,105
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

307
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,609
The FBI and the CIA
and J Edgar Hoover and oil companies...

308
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,072
...and the Pentagon and the men's room
attendant at the White House.

309
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,950
I would leave out
the men's room attendant.

310
00:17:55,951 --> 00:18:00,951
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

311
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,040
Oh, my God!

312
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,750
She's right.

313
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,961
Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?

314
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:10,590
She was beautiful, she was willing,
she was real intelligent.

315
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:15,344
Is it the old Groucho Marx joke that
I just don't wanna belong to any club...

316
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,431
...that would have
someone like me for a member?

317
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,600
Alvy, don't panic! Please stop it!

318
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,603
It's a mistake to ever bring
a live thing in the house.

319
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,771
Stop it! Go for that one there.

320
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,609
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911. It's the lobster squad.

321
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,278
They're only baby ones, for God's sakes.

322
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,781
- If they're only babies, you pick 'em up.
- All right! All right!

323
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,409
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me! Don't!

324
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,370
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

325
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,539
It'll turn up in our bed at night.

326
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,667
Will you get out of here
with that thing? Jesus!

327
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,629
Talk to 'em. You speak shellfish.

328
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,797
Hey, look. Put it in the pot.

329
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,760
I can't put it in the pot!
I can't put a live thing in hot water!

330
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,721
You think we're gonna
take him to the movies?

331
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,806
Oh, good, Alvy. Oh, thank you.

332
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,434
OK. It's in. It's definitely in the pot.

333
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,021
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

334
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,398
I can't get it out. This thing's heavy.

335
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,778
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce here
with a nutcracker, it'll run out.

336
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,947
I'm gonna get my camera.

337
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:18,199
I think if I could pry the door off...

338
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,702
We should have gotten steaks.
They don't run around.

339
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,705
(Annie screams) Goddamn it! Oh, jeez!

340
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,291
Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.

341
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,460
You're gonna take pictures now?

342
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,046
Alvy, it'll be wonderful. Oh, lovely!

343
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,215
Oh, God! That's disgusting!

344
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,133
One more, Alvy. Please!

345
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,927
Oh, good! Good!

346
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,514
Here's what I want to know.
Am I your first big romance?

347
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,266
Oh, no. No, no. Uh-uh.

348
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,684
Really? Who was?

349
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,020
There was Dennis
from Chippewa Falls High School.

350
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:52,149
(Alvy) Dennis? Local kid? Would
meet you in front of the movie house?

351
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,069
(Annie) You should have seen
how I looked then.

352
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,905
(Alvy) Oh, I can imagine.
The wife of an astronaut.

353
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,157
(Annie) Then there was Jerry, the actor.

354
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,326
Look at you. You're such a clown.

355
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,995
I look pretty.

356
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,539
You always look pretty. But that guy...

357
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,751
Acting is like an exploration of the soul.
It's very religious.

358
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,547
Like a kind of liberating consciousness.

359
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,799
It's like a visual poem.

360
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,010
Is he kidding with that crap?

361
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,178
Oh, right. (laughs)

362
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,057
I think I know exactly what you mean
when you say "religious".

363
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,183
You do?

364
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:29,687
- Oh, come on. I was younger.
- Hey, that was last year.

365
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,856
It's like when I think of dying.

366
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,442
- You know how I'd like to die?
- No. How?

367
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,236
I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

368
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,405
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels!

369
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:44,406
Listen, he was a terrific actor.
He's neat-looking and he was emotional...

370
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,038
I don't think you like emotion too much.

371
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,874
Touch my heart... with your foot.

372
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,043
I may throw up.

373
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,211
(Annie) He was creepy.

374
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,089
(Alvy) I think you're pretty lucky
I came along.

375
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,467
(Annie) Oh, really? Well, la-de-da.

376
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:03,304
(Alvy) If anyone had ever told me
I would be taking out a girl...

377
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,015
...who used expressions like la-de-da...

378
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,934
(Annie) You really like
those New York girls.

379
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,938
- Well, not just. Not only.
- I'd say so. You married two of them.

380
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,817
There's Henry Drucker.
He has a chair in history at Princeton.

381
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:21,197
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a chair in philosophy at Cornell.

382
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,699
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

383
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,161
- Why are you so hostile?
- Cos I wanna watch the Knicks on TV.

384
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,330
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

385
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,750
Be nice to the host,
because he's pu

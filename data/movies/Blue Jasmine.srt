Ã¯Â»Â¿1
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,259
There was no one like Hal.

2
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,061
He met me at a party
and swept me off my feet.

3
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,764
"Blue Moon" was playing.

4
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,474
You know "Blue Moon?"
Sure.

5
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,026
I still remember that.
Oh.

6
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,694
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª Blue moon Ã¢ÂÂªÃ¢ÂÂª</i>

7
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,153
And one more year
and I would have graduated.

8
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,202
But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,
what was I learning at school anyway?

9
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,451
I mean, can you picture me
as an anthropologist?

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,992
Is that a joke?

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,545
The sex was always great. Well,
he was nine years older than me.

12
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,748
He'd already made
and lost a fortune.

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,005
But then he made it back,
and more. I mean, much more.

14
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,506
God, he was dynamic.

15
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,430
Taught me everything I know
about real lovemaking,

16
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,850
not that I care to get too graphic.

17
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,270
Believe me when I tell you.
They tried six medications on me.

18
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,097
Cocktails, they call them.

19
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,899
The only cocktail that helped
was a Stoli martini.

20
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,351
I never trusted doctors.

21
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,187
Doctors put both my parents
in early graves.

22
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,238
I have never
been to San Francisco.

23
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,443
And Hal and I traveled everywhere.
I hear it's beautiful.

24
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,495
I'll be staying with my sister,
Ginger. She's divorced.

25
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,916
Biologically, she's not my sister.
She's adopted. <i>We're</i> both adopted.

26
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,869
I couldn't stand her ex-husband.
He used to hit her.

27
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,046
That's mine. The Vuitton.

28
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,125
My plan is to start a new life out here.
Hm.

29
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,961
Put everything behind me
and start fresh.

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,390
Go West. Was it Horace Greeley
who said that? "Go West."

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,890
Oh, there's my family.
It was really nice talking to you.

32
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,688
Oh, I'll call you,
maybe for lunch.

33
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,232
I don't have your number.

34
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:07,275
Who's that woman you were talking to?
I was sitting next to her on the plane.

35
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,901
She was talking to herself.

36
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,780
I thought she said something to me.
I said, "What?"

37
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,987
But she couldn't stop
babbling about her life.

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,673
Where--? Where am I exactly?

39
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,101
You said 305 South Van Ness.

40
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,311
- Can you wait, help me with my bags?
- Sure.

41
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,069
I don't know where she is.

42
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,491
She expected me.

43
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,657
The plane was on time.

44
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,624
Yes, I'm-- I'm--
You all right?

45
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,803
I'm fine. I just sometimes get
where I can't take a deep breath

46
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:17,884
and when I can, it makes me panic
and it makes it even worse.

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,764
Okay.

48
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,014
Could I have some privacy?
Sure, sure.

49
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,974
Hello, Ginger?

50
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,652
Yes, I'm here.
I'm right in front of the place.

51
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,980
It is 305?

52
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,985
Uh-huh.

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,864
Ugh. Well, how long?

54
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,155
What? Where is it?

55
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,866
No, no, I see it.
Okay. Oh, okay.

56
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,544
Just-- Would you please hurry?
My sister left the keys in the bar.

57
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,713
- Can you wait?
- Sure.

58
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,980
Is that it?

59
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,277
Thank you.

60
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,204
Oh, thank you.

61
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,408
Have a great day, all right?
Bye-bye.

62
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,423
So, what do you think?
I love it.

63
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,547
The fireplaces work. I don't
like when they're for show.

64
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,550
It's so light and airy
and the ceilings are so high.

65
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,598
How can anyone breathe
with a low ceiling? The view.

66
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,393
You wanted Fifth Avenue.
Central Park. Superb.

67
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,311
Oh, this space is perfect.

68
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,230
We hardly have to do a thing.

69
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,774
You shouldn't spoil me so.
Well, why not?

70
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,569
Who else am I gonna spoil?
Did I tell you my news?

71
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,897
What?
Danny is gonna be living with us.

72
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,153
Oh, honey.
Oh, that's great news.

73
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,530
I worked it out with his mom,
her lawyers.

74
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,455
Oh, he'll be so much happier
when he's with us full-time.

75
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,122
Happy birthday, Danny.

76
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,543
Kids at school say we're really rich
and that you give money to charity.

77
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,591
Sure I do. You gotta remember
as you go through life

78
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,511
to share what you earn
with the less fortunate.

79
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,431
Not everyone is as lucky
as we are.

80
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,757
Domingo?
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,719
Another bottle of the Margaux.
Sure.

82
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,183
Excuse me.

83
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,765
It would look perfect.
Wouldn't wash me out?

84
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,691
No, not at all.
Not the way he--

85
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,566
Oh, isn't he sweet?

86
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,067
This song was playing
when Hal and I first met.

87
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,445
- I fell in love with the name Jasmine.
- Oh, so romantic.

88
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:47,867
I changed it.
Yeah, Jeanette had no panache.

89
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,172
This song was playing
when we first met.

90
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,422
You know it? Yeah, we met
at a party at Martha's Vineyard.

91
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,842
"Blue Moon."

92
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,798
Come on, boys.

93
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,099
Okay, let's go, Augie.
I gotta get home. Someone's waiting.

94
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,305
We helped Dad
move the furniture today.

95
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,187
Oh, really? That's
your idea of taking the boys?

96
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,315
Letting them help you
lug somebody's furniture upstairs?

97
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,487
- They loved it. Great exercise.
- Yeah?

98
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,441
They-- We ate franks and beans.
- Yeah.

99
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,494
- Relax.
- Let's go, Johnny, come on.

100
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,493
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.
- What's the rush?

101
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,916
What's the rush, Ginger?
You got a date?

102
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,584
It's none of your business.

103
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,085
It happens to be Jeanette, so...
Jeanette?

104
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,165
Jasmine?
What is she doing in town?

105
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,093
She's living with me
till she gets back on her feet.

106
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,011
She's had a bad time. Yeah.
Uh-huh.

107
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,965
When she had money,
she wanted nothing to do with you.

108
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,175
Now that she's broke,
she's moving in.

109
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,386
She's not just broke.
She's screwed up.

110
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,143
And it's none of your damn
business. She's family.

111
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,849
She stole our money.
Okay.

112
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,187
Understand? We could have been set.
That was our whole chance in life.

113
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,491
For the last time, Augie,
he was the crook, not her, okay?

114
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,819
What the hell did she know
about finance?

115
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,826
Don't stand there and tell me that.
She's married to a guy for years,

116
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,874
up to his ass in phony real estate
and bank fraud.

117
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,702
She knew nothing about it?

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,505
Believe me, she knew, Ginger.
Okay? She knew.

119
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,710
But when all those diamonds
and minks were flying in,

120
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,046
she just looked the other way.
I don't think so, Augie.

121
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:29,556
You said it. You said to me,
"She's a phony and had to know."

122
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,979
Jasmine, your country
house is so beautiful.

123
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,807
See?
I'm sorry, but we need an answer on this.

124
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,690
I told you, you change the name
of the corporation.

125
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,988
Operate under Global Innovations.
I don't know if we can.

126
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,531
I think we can, actually.

127
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,360
- Pay out of the accounts in Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam.

128
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,368
Whenever I hear them, they're one
step ahead of the Justice Department.

129
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,415
Just hope your house is not bugged.
Ha, ha, ha.

130
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,459
Oh, I never pay attention
to Hal's business affairs.

131
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,662
I have no head
for that sort of thing.

132
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,250
We transfer to the old corporation?
We could. Perfectly legal.

133
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,713
It would be a mistake under that name.
Definitely get in trouble for that.

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,139
Just don't file a joint
tax return. Ha, ha, ha.

135
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,014
Don't say that. I sign anything.
I'm very trusting.

136
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,561
Famous last words.

137
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,140
It's called looking
the other way.

138
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,228
Jasmine. Oh, my God.
Oh.

139
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,404
Look at you.
Look at you.

140
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,028
Oh, I am so sorry for the wait.

141
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,451
Sorry, I think I'm in Paris.
It's okay.

142
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,949
No, it's fine.
Augie's day with the boys.

143
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,906
Well, no wonder you're late.

144
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,832
Hello. Matthew, is it?
Yeah.

145
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,627
Boys, say hello.
I told you about her, remember?

146
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,296
Hi, I'm Jasmine.
Shake hands. Okay, go play.

147
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,919
They're big.
I know.

148
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,251
I'm getting it first.
Quiet, you two.

149
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,087
Well, they're loud.
Stop running around.

150
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,048
Christ, this kid's got--
What the hell is it? ADD?

151
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,727
- Yeah. Your place is homey.
- Are you kidding me?

152
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,478
No, I mean, it's got a very--
Well, it's casual charm.

153
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,355
God, knock it off,
Jasmine.

154
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,065
I need to stay here for a while.
No, I do.

155
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,696
I'm out of cash.
Okay.

156
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,619
Couldn't pay my rent in Brooklyn.
Can you believe

157
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,824
I had to move out of my home,
take a place in Brooklyn?

158
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,126
But I'm dead broke. Really,
the government took everything.

159
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,999
And the lawyers.

160
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,830
And I can't be alone, Ginger.

161
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,632
I really get some bad thoughts
when I'm alone.

162
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,337
Well, you know, all I can say is,
you look great.

163
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,799
Oh. Now who's lying?
You do.

164
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,850
You know, I was up all last night.
I was so anxious

165
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,553
Yeah? about moving hem

166
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,482
I wasn't sure how angry you still were.
Oh, well...

167
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,568
Another drink? We're celebrating.
Of course, yeah.

168
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,022
Oh, the flight was bumpy.
Uh-huh.

169
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,360
I didn't eat anything on the plane.
Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.

170
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,412
I mean, you'd think
first class, right?

171
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,493
You flew first class?

172
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,417
I don't know how anyone puts up
with those airlines.

173
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,338
Isn't first class a fortune?
Yes, I was quite shocked.

174
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,463
I thought you were tapped out.
I'm worse than tapped out, baby.

175
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,886
I've run up some serious debts.

176
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,884
So how did you fly first class?

177
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,934
I don't know, Ginger.
I just did.

178
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,888
All I meant was, if you've got
no money, to go first class...

179
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,895
You know me.
I splurge from habit.

180
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,149
Would you stop staring
at my luggage?

181
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,526
Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.

182
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,409
You told me you had to sell everything.
Look, look, look.

183
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,410
These are used, old suitcases.
See, with my initials. Who'd want them?

184
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,959
I sold what jewels and furs
I could hide from Uncle Sam.

185
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,002
God, I hate to tell you about that.

186
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,458
Jewelry is priceless, a great investment
when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef

187
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,669
until you're desperate for money
and forced to sell,

188
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,096
and then it seems
you can't give it away.

189
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,888
Kids, stop it, come on!

190
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,849
- Were you adopted?
- Yes.

191
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,897
We were both adopted.

192
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,271
Born to different moms and dads, but
raised by the same morn and dad.

193
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,612
Could you stop doing
that gun thing? Sorry.

194
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,861
- Got migraine from the pressurized cabin.
- Matthew.

195
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,194
Did you like
the new mom and dad?

196
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,369
Yes, of course--
Aunt Jasmine did.

197
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,744
I ran away from home as fast
as my feet could carry me.

198
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,951
How come?
Well--

199
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,628
Our mother liked Aunt Jasmine
and not me.

200
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,922
Oh, stop.
How come?

201
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,295
She had better genes.
Don't tell them that.

202
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,133
Well, am I lying?
Dad said you're glad we lived far away.

203
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,964
What?

204
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,722
They're perfect for the dress
that I'm wearing to the Met Gala.

205
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,477
What's the matter?
Your mind is a million miles away.

206
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:49,653
Oh, I'm sorry. No, I-- I just got
a call from my sister, Ginger.

207
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:54,153
Oh, God, she's coming to New York
for a week with her husband, Augie.

208
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,825
He is a piece of work.

209
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,619
I just-- I don't know,
I guess I have to see them.

210
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,198
The one in San Francisco, the builder?
Yeah.

211
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:05,081
Oh, no, he's a contractor. I mean,
he's-- No, he's a handyman.

212
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,414
No, don't get me wrong.
I love Ginger, I do. She's a dear.

213
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,545
But our paths just went
in totally different directions.

214
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,841
Okay, that happens.

215
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,046
It's terrible of me to say,
but she was never too bright.

216
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,724
You know? And she was so wild
and I, of course, was Miss Perfect.

217
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,595
- Hi.
- Oh, you made it.

218
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,851
How lovely to see you.
Hi. Oh, my God.

219
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,648
Welcome.
Hi. Thank you.

220
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,022
Oh, this is my husband, Augie.
Augie.

221
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,399
This is Jeanette.
Jasmine. I changed it.

222
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,197
Jasmine.
I'm finally getting to meet the sister.

223
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:39,278
I know. Hello. I'm so sorry we
couldn't make it to the wedding.

224
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,988
Just that Hal had some
business in Saint-Tropez.

225
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,198
Couldn't get back in time.
Know what?

226
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,832
You missed a nice little party.
My friend Dennis sang.

227
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,539
He's great. Dennis Rackabuto.
I know. Hey--

228
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,421
Hal! You remember
Ginger.

229
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,001
Oh, my gosh.
How are you?

230
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,711
How are you?
This is Augie.

231
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,592
Augie. How you doing?
Awesome.

232
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,719
Hell of a place you got.
Thank you.

233
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,800
Why don't you come through?
Told you.

234
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,890
- Yvette, coffee?
- This is really...

235
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,266
Yeah, she's got taste.

236
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,439
It's like what
you see in the movies.

237
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,394
We have so much to catch up on. Can't
wait for you to show us New York.

238
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,604
Why don't you take
our car and driver?

239
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:18,066
Well, I hope you're gonna come.
I mean, how often am I here?

240
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,154
- No, no, I will definitely make some time.
- Oh, good. Heh, heh.

241
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,244
Where are you staying?

242
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,952
Oh, well, we-- We thought about
asking if we could stay with you,

243
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,585
but we don't wanna impose,
so we got a room at the Marriott.

244
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,632
Oh, the Marriott's perfect.
Oh. Yeah.

245
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,836
I'll have my office contact them
and forward us the bill.

246
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,263
Oh, no.
No, no, no, it's not necessary.

247
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,591
Please, you're our guests.
I insist.

248
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,224
Oh, well, then we insist
on taking you two to dinner tonight.

249
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,773
- What? Tonight?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,563
We have dinner plans.

251
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,691
I don't think we can--
Something we can't get out of.

252
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,397
I'm sorry' GINGER: There'll be time.

253
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,905
We stashed the kids with Augie's
sister, we're here for a week.

254
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,952
It's gonna be great.
It is. Okay.

255
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,701
Well, we don't have
a lot of free time,

256
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,829
but we'll definitely take you
to Le Cirque, won't we?

257
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,455
I mean, or Daniel. I mean--

258
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,459
They'd get a kick out of that.
Yeah, absolutely.

259
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,918
I know your birthday is this week.
Let us at least take you out for that.

260
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,465
I love how you're doing your hair.
Oh, thanks. Heh, heh.

261
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,928
You'll have to take me shopping. You
always could pick clothes. Heh, heh.

262
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,307
And Augie's got
some exciting business news

263
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,643
he wants to talk to Hal about.
Oh?

264
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,695
Don't worry, I don't need to
borrow money. We're flush.

265
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,114
Yeah,
What kind of work do you do, Augie?

266
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,659
Well, you know, I do, like,
repairs, furniture moving,

267
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,862
but I got plans to be
my own boss.

268
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,744
We'll talk about it over dinner.
They're going out.

269
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,370
Hey, could we have a tour?

270
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,830
Oh, yeah, of course. Why don't
you start in the kitchen?

271
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,132
Is there a little girls' room?
Just down the hall.

272
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,383
Wow.

273
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,089
Five days.

274
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,013
I'll have to invite them
to my birthday party now.

275
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,013
Where did she come up with him?
I always feel so guilty around Ginger.

276
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,016
We've got to make sure
we make their stay extra nice.

277
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,224
My God, five days.

278
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,444
Look.

279
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,148
It's so beautiful.
Oh.

280
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,358
Oh, but where would I wear
a Fendi bag?

281
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,740
Oh, go ahead. It's my treat.

282
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,072
No.
Yeah.

283
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,406
Really?

284
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,285
Oh, my God. I love it. Look.

285
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,711
Look.

286
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,711
Take the other one off.
No, I like this.

287
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,800
Boy, this is some place
you got here.

288
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,302
- I mean, this is unreal.
- It is.

289
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,259
Reminds me
of when I was a kid.

290
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,889
I used to be a lifeguard.

291
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,721
Start your own construction
company? Great idea.

292
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,399
We came into some money.
Tell him how, Augie.

293
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,897
What? We've been saving this story.

294
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,651
Well, the first 10-, 12,000,
I really worked for.

295
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,482
Put away a little each week.

296
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,692
But he's not
telling you the big news.

297
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,995
Why we're in New York.
You tell them.

298
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,243
Okay, I will.

299
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,949
We always play the lottery,

300
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,785
and we never even get two numbers.
Am I right?

301
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,080
Uh-huh.
But last week, we hit it.

302
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,164
We got 200,000 bucks.

303
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,751
Oh, that's fantastic.

304
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,007
I thought I'd drop dead.
That's great.

305
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,260
I never held that kind of money
in my hands. I mean, ever.

306
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,057
He was shaking
when we won.

307
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,263
Me? You had to see her. I had to tell
her, this is a once-in-a-lifetime.

308
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,097
Congratulations.
Yeah.

309
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,434
He wants to begin a business.
What do you think?

310
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:44,193
Well, if you like, I think Hal could
probably help you do better.

311
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,444
Yeah?

312
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:50,279
You know-- You know, I'm no gambler.
I mean, not with my one chance to--

313
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,582
Hey, come on. We don't know the first
thing about money, but he does.

314
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,161
First thing is how not to give half
your money to the government.

315
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,248
Look, I know there's taxes,
but, I mean, what can I do?

316
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,628
- There are ways.
- You see, Augie? You see?

317
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,508
Suppose I put you in a venture
that was low-risk, but very high-yield.

318
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,262
I'm not talking about 6 or 7 percent.
I'm talking about 20 percent.

319
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,138
Profitable enough?
20 percent?

320
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,141
He's developing a group of hotels
in the Caribbean.

321
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,474
You mean, not starting
my own business.

322
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,980
No, we mean investing with Hal.

323
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,313
Jeez, investing what?
You mean the whole thing?

324
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,944
You need money to make money.
Am I right?

325
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,237
Ginger.

326
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,321
Let them in on one of your--?
The hotel deal or something.

327
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,747
It'd be great for them.
Make a killing.

328
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,871
Pay attention, Augie.
I'm paying attention.

329
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,083
You will make money for them,
won't you?

330
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,085
I make money,
they make money.

331
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,087
God, they're hard work.

332
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,339
Tomorrow I'm taking
the day off.

333
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,547
I've neglected everything,
my yoga, my Pilates.

334
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,507
I've got that luncheon to plan,

335
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,434
the fundraiser
for the Central Park Conservancy.

336
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,808
I've rented them a limo
and a driver,

337
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,856
and I've suggested they go
to the South Street Seaport.

338
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,644
Can you imagine
if they lived here?

339
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,028
Here, for doing your duty.

340
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,825
Happy birthday.
Oh.

341
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,034
I'm giving it to you now so you can
wear it to your party tomorrow night.

342
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:20,039
Oh, sweetheart, it's beautiful.

343
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,712
Not bad taste for
a philistine businessman, huh?

344
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,094
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª A good man is hard to find Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

345
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,723
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª Well, you always get the other kind Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

346
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:40,013
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª And just when you think
He's your one best pal Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

347
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,650
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª You look around
You find him lovin' another gal Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

348
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,689
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª You rave
Yes, you crave Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

349
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:53,325
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª To see that man laying in his grave Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

350
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:58,661
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª So if your man is nice
Take my advice Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

351
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:03,374
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª And hug him in the morning
Hug him every night Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

352
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:08,212
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª Give him plenty lovin'
Be sure you love him right Ã¢ÂÂª</i>

353
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:15,508
<i>Ã¢ÂÂª 'Cause a good man nowadays
Is hard to find Ã¢ÂÂªÃ¢ÂÂª</i>

354
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,054
I know, it's so extravagant.
Oh, look at that.

355
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,807
He surprised me in the tub, so to speak.
Ha, ha, ha.

356
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,811
Corsica's a bore. The weather's nice,
but it's nothing like Sardinia.

357
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,360
This year you are coming
to Palm Beach, no excuses.

358
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:13,152
Hey, Jasmine.
What?

359
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,778
Who's that woman?
Which?

360
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,485
That one.
Oh, Raylene.

361
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,787
She's a friend.
I love Raylene.

362
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,660
We met in a yoga class.

363
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,616
Isn't she pretty?
Yeah.

364
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,576
She runs a modeling agency.

365
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,208
How long have you known her?
Few years. Why?

366
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,716
- And you trust her?
- Trust her?

367
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,386
Of course I trust her.
What kind of question is that?

368
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,260
She just seems so cozy all night
with your husband.

369
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,889
I wouldn't worry. Hal's not
the roving type, nor is Raylene.

370
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,595
She's a very close friend.
I don't know.

371
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,148
If it was my husband,
I'd keep an eye on him.

372
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:51,273
Goodness,
you are a suspicious one.

373
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,195
I'm just saying.
Just relax.

374
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,397
I am relaxed.

375
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,701
You shouldn't drink
so much, Augie.

376
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,326
Nobody wants to hear those
stupid Polish jokes, you know?

377
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,532
Oh, I had a drink?

378
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,787
Yeah? Yeah.

379
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,918
Let me tell you, you were half in
the bag the entire night, okay?

380
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,249
Tell me about my drinking.

381
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,882
Give me that.
What's eating you?

382
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,746
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

383
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,665
Hey.

384
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,639
What?
Would you tell your friend?

385
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,096
I'm talking.
Tell him what?

386
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,436
Are you listening to me?

387
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,111
If you saw your friend's wife kissing
another guy, would you tell your friend?

388
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,688
Would you tell him?
Yeah.

389
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,991
Bet your ass I'd tell him.
But what if it causes trouble?

390
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,613
Or maybe a divorce?

391
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,947
If you don't say anything,
it could've been a passing thing.

392
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,828
He never knows and he lives on
happy with his wife.

393
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,753
You know, I would tell him,
because that's what a friend's for.

394
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,923
You gotta have his back.
That's why I'd tell him.

395
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,922
It's a tough call, Augie.
I don't know.

396
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,921
Ginger.
What?

397
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,598
What are we doing?
Are we playing charades?

398
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,266
I mean, come on.

399
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,935
Did you see something?
Yeah.

400
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,639
On the street, by accident.

401
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:13,852

Hey, love bug.
You ready?

00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,683
Oh, yeah.

4
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,309
Hey, guess what, Mom?
What?

5
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,141
I figured out where
<i>wasps</i> come from.

6
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,817
Oh, yeah? Where?

7
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,065
Well, I think
it must be,

8
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,400
if you flick water into the air
just right, it'll turn into a wasp.

9
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,325
Hey!
Yep.

10
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,618
That's cool.

11
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,113
So, how was your day
at school?

12
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,948
MASON: Fine.

13
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,161
I had a good meeting with Miss Butler
this time. I kind of liked her.

14
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,120
What'd she say?

15
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,831
Well, she said that you weren't
turning in your homework assignments.

16
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,131
And I told her,
"I know he does them,

17
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,800
"'cause I check them
every night."

18
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,423
She said she found
a big chunk of them

19
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,800
crumpled up at the bottom
of your backpack.

20
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,427
She didn't ask for 'em.

21
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,259
Baby, she doesn't have to. You're
just supposed to turn them in.

22
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,101
And she said you're still
staring out the window all day.

23
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,186
Not all day.

24
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,902
And she said that you destroyed
her pencil sharpener.

25
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,904
Not on purpose!

26
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,152
Wait! She said that you crammed
a bunch of rocks in it.

27
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,151
I thought if we could
sharpen pencils,

28
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,985
maybe we could
sharpen rocks.

(CHUCKLES)

30
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,623
Well, what were you gonna do
with a bunch of sharpened rocks?

31
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,044
I was trying to make arrowheads
for my rock collection.

32
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,209
Hmm.

33
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,484

00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,606

00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,159
Bumpers are for kids!

317
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,165
What are you,
two years old?

318
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,791
You don't want the bumpers.

319
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,919
Life doesn't
give you bumpers.

320
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,722
There we, there we go. There we go!
We got something there!

321
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,639
We got something!
We got something!

322
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,932
Oh!

323
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,139
Last time I went bowling, we had
bumpers and it was a lot more fun!

324
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,974
You don't want the bumpers,
all right'?

325
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,434
You bowl a strike
with the bumpers

326
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,064
and it doesn't
mean anything.

327
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,190
Trust me.

328
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,107
Just lay it out
on the lane.

329
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,945
One, two, three and...
(MOUTHING)

330
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:10,988
(SHOUTS)

331
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,734
Let's hear it
for the father!

332
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,783
Boom!

333
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,956
Get up there!
SAMANTHA: Great shot!

334
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,288
MASON SR.:
Get out there, girl!

335
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,879
MALE NEWS <i>ANCHOR: Four Blackwater
operatives have been viciously attacked</i>

336
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,430
<i>in their cars in Fallujah.</i>

337
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,884
<i>The bodies and cars were set on
fire after insurgents started...</i>

338
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,685
MASON SR.: Look at this!
It's a disaster.

339
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,767
Let me tell you what's
happening in Iraq, all right?

340
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,348
Exactly what every thinking
person in the world

341
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,525
knew was gonna happen
before they got started.

342
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,230
But Bush and his little numb-nut
fanatics he's got around him,

343
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,564
they don't give
a rat's ass.

344
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,781
That's a quarter.

345
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,149
What's a quarter?

346
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,610
You said A-S-S.

347
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,620
Oh, sorry. My bad.

348
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:52,697
(SIGHS)

349
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,874
And my teacher says
it's a good war,

350
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,872
because it's better
to be safe than sorry.

351
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,123
That's what they're
teaching you in school?

352
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,375
All right. Listen to me.
Listen to your father, okay?

353
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,877
That is the lie.
That's the big lie.

354
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,506
Iraq had nothing to do with what
happened at the World Trade Center.

355
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,586
You know that, right?

356
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,300
I guess.

357
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,381
Who you gonna vote
for next fall, MJ?

358
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,098
I don't know.

359
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,801
He can't vote.
He's not 18.

360
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,289
All right,
who would you vote for?

361
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,518
Kerry?

362
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,147
Anybody but Bush! Okay?

363
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,148
Are you gonna move back?

364
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,447
Uh, I'm planning on it.
You know, I gotta find a job.

365
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,359
Are you and Mom
gonna get back together?

366
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,784
I don't know.

367
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,909
That's not, uh, entirely
up to me, you know?

368
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,375
SAMANTHA: I remember
when I was six,

369
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,125
you and Mom
were fighting like mad.

370
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,457
You were yelling so loud
and she was crying.

371
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,755
That's what
you remember, huh?

372
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,835
Yep.

373
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,171
You don't remember
the trips to Galveston,

374
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,473
camping in Big Bend,
all the fun we had?

375
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,549
Nope.

376
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,264
You ever get mad
at your mother'?

377
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,391
Yeah.

378
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,055
You ever get mad at your brother?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

379
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,224
Yeah. You ever yell at him?
Oh, yeah.

380
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,526
Doesn't mean you
don't love him, right?

381
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,978
Mmm...
(MASON SR. CHUCKLES)

382
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,780
Look, the same thing happens
when you're grown up, all right?

383
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,323
You know,
you get mad at people.

384
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,742
You know,
it's not a big deal.

385
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,736
What'd you do in Alaska?

386
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,369
I worked on a boat
for a while. Um...

387
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,334
I tried to write some music.

388
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,249
Did you see
any polar bears?

389
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,376
(CHUCKLING) No.
But I saw a Kodiak bear.

390
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,798
It was fuckin' huge!

391
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,922
Dad! That's 50 cents
for the F-word!

392
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,596
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)

393
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,892
Here, take a dollar, all right?
Keep the change.

394
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,179
You guys are gonna be seeing
a lot more of me. Okay?

395
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,686
I missed you two real bad while I was
gone, okay, I want you to know that.

396
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,065
I just needed to take some
time, you know, to...

397
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,437
Just...

398
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,232
Your mom and me, okay...

399
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,696
Well, your mother, okay,
is a piece of work, all right.

400
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,999
I think you know that
by now, all right?

401
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,663
And I'm just...

402
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,586
I'm so happy to be
with the two of you, okay?

403
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,879
And I'm sorry about
that bumper business.

404
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,458
I'm gonna get better
at stuff like that, okay?

405
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,840
MASON: I got that one
at Dripping Springs,

406
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,297
and, um, my friend Rodney
gave me that one.

407
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,882
MASON SR.: Yeah?
MASON: And I bought that one.

408
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,387
You bought this one?
Yeah.

409
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,719
You found this at Dripping Springs?
Uh-huh.

410
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,019
Wow.

411
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,687
What else do you got?

412
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,857
Well, um,
these are snake vertebrae.

413
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,568
Snake vertebrae? That's disgusting.
Huh? (CHUCKLES)

414
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,770
Mason, I don't want you collecting
snake vertebrae anymore.

415
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:30,980
(BOTH LAUGH)

416
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,360
Is this the feather
I sent you?

417
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,908
Yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it is.

418
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:38,238
Oh, Dad! Um, l forgot to show you,
um, these basketball pictures.

419
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,914
You're on a basketball team?
Yeah.

420
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,412
Wow! Check you out!

421
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,788
These are beaver claws.
Beaver claws?

422
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:44,869
SAMANTHA: That's me.

423
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,917
MASON: (CHUCKLES) Yeah. No. MASON
SR.: What, you hunting beaver'?

424
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,748
You see, that's McKinney,
that's Meg and that's Gem.

425
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,832
Those are my friends.
Uh-huh.

426
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,087
What position
do you play?

427
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,259
Um, guard.

428
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,586
This is dried Canadian grass.
Uh-huh.

429
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,949
Wait, have you
scored any points?

430
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,204
Well, about eight
or 10 a game.

431
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,383
Eight or 10 a game?
That is awesome!

432
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,685
Once, she didn't score any
and she cried!

433
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,761
You cried?

434
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,016
Well, only a little bit.
Aw...

435
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,096
(CHUCKLES)

436
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,773
Hello!
Pomegranate.

437
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,442
Oh, Mason, Mom's home!

438
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,643
Mom's home!

439
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,853
Mom's home.

440
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,320
Mom! Hi! Look at this owl
Daddy gave me!

441
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,527
Isn't it cool?
See, its head spins!

442
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,488
And look at this bracelet. It
was made by Indians in Alaska.

443
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,121
And Daddy made this cool hand-carved
grizzly bear and this tiki.

444
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,952
OLIVIA: It's a totem.
SAMANTHA: And guess what else?

445
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,164
We went bowling and I made four strikes!
(CHUCKLES)

446
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,840
Yeah, and we got to ride
around in Dad's car! Wow.

447
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,793
Hey, Liv.
Hey.

448
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,423
I know you wanted me to drop
them off at your mom's.

449
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,221
I just thought it'd be easier
if I brou

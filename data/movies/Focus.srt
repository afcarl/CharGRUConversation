Ã¯Â»Â¿1
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,248
<i>Elegio, how may I help you?</i>

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
<i>Yes, I'd like to make a reservation
for tonight, please.</i>

3
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,010
<i>- Sorry. We're booked months in advance.
MAN". Okay. I understand.</i>

4
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,810
Thank you very much.

5
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,728
<i>Elegio reservations, how may I help you?</i>

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,326
Order.

7
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,648
- Is that ready? Thanks.
- Yeah.

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,130
Gets another dollop of the burrata.
There you go.

9
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,642
No problem. I can get that for you, sir.

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,011
Okay, you know what?

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,523
So, yeah, you know...

12
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,167
...he could be here any minute now.

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,766
Ah, heh-heh.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,725
Oh, look, you know what?

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,644
He's right there. That's my friend.

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,721
Will you be my boyfriend?

17
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,041
Just for a minute.

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,247
- You're not a serial killer, are you?
-That depends.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,880
How many times does it take
to get to "serial"?

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Five.

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,686
Oh, no, we're good.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,040
Jess.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,446
Nicky.

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,604
Heh. Burgundy.

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,404
Very good.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,446
- It's very confusing, isn't it?
- Hm.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,290
How do you know it all?

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,761
- Mostly from drinking.
-Mm.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,571
Yeah. More you drink, more you learn.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,770
In that case, I am, uh,
the foremost expert in JÃÂ¤gerbombs.

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,528
I will walk you through it all...

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,286
It's been a pleasure to serve you,
Chef Oshowole.

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,691
Chef who?

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,649
Uh, Oshowole.

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,842
Yeah. Heh.

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,209
You know, it may be the roofies talking,
but this was really fun.

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,364
Thank you. Thank you for rescuing me.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,883
- Yeah. We showed him.
-Yeah.

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,281
Gotta respect him.
He left it all on the field.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,889
- That's what I'm missing out on tonight?
-Ha-ha-ha.

41
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,280
Can I walk you somewhere?

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,926
Actually, I'm staying here.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,484
Upstairs.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,091
Oh, really.

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,003
- Oh, my God. It's my husband.
-Shut the fuck up.

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,969
- Jared, wait.
-Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,929
- I'll fucking kill you.
-Just let him go.

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,730
No fucking way. He's fucking dead.

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,451
Give me one fucking reason
why I shouldn't do it.

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,329
- I'm drawing a blank.
-What?

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,490
I think you should shoot me.
Let's be honest, you've been aggrieved.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,529
Don't mess with him, Nicky,
he's done hard time.

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,444
I've done fucking hard time.

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,762
If you had any idea what I was
about to do to her...

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,288
- Shut up, man.
-She was gonna be no good to you after that.

56
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,920
- So you should really shoot me.
-What the fuck?

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,602
- What kind of stuff are we talking about?
-Saudi bachelor party shit.

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,489
Saudi bachelor party?

59
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,325
R. Kelly drop-cloth shit.

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,686
Please, come on, shoot me.

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,042
Stop fucking around.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,680
You'd really be doing me a favor.
Cancer.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,321
Tumor the size of a peach.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,970
Pull the trigger, you'll see.

65
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,565
You--? You got cancer?

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,042
- He's onto us.
-Shit! I knew this wasn't gonna fucking work!

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,248
- You guys suck.
-Just give us the money.

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,965
- Or?
- He'll shoot you in the neck.

69
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,488
I don't wanna shoot a guy with cancer.
Grandma Mukulski had cancer.

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,405
- He doesn't have cancer, you idiot!
-You guys really boned this thing.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,722
First of all, you gotta wait
till she gets my pants off.

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,963
And then you gotta give me a chance
to run. That's how you get the money.

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,208
And you never drop the con.

74
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,566
You never break.

75
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,006
Die with the lie.

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,446
When did you make us?

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Uh, when you stole the wallet
from the bum downstairs.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,571
Bullshit.

79
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,725
No, real shit.

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,082
Then Why'd you come up here
if you're so smart?

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,608
Professional curiosity.

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,290
And I like boobs, you know.

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,930
I figured it was a win-win.

84
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,641
- All thumbs, sweetheart. It was a bum lift.
-It was a great lift.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,690
Please. He was so shithoused,
you could've taken his appendix.

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,569
You suck.

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,922
You really should be more aware.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,924
I've been behind you for two blocks.
You didn't see me?

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,481
I don't have eyes in the back of my head.

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,928
Well, if you're gonna play this game,
you might wanna grow a pair.

91
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,120
I can take care of myself.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,964
No, you're gonna get hurt.

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,690
Let me buy you coffee.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,450
I don't drink coffee.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,486
Fine.

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,486
Fine.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,366
So, what's your thing?

98
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,729
- Inside? Roper? You can tell me.
-Mm.

99
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,769
Everything. Been in this game so long.

100
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,969
- I wanna cannon. That's what I wanna do.
-Oh, really?

101
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,168
- Yeah.
-Yeah, okay.

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,125
My grandfather used to run
a crooked game in Harlem.

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,971
Eventually, my father started
shilling for him.

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,366
Uh...

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,124
One day they get burned.

106
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,568
Mobbed-up guy catches them
throwing signals.

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,008
Everybody's guns come out. Standoff.

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,162
No way out. Except one.

109
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,607
The Toledo Panic Button.

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,606
What the hell is that?

111
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,121
You shoot your partner.
It proves you're not together.

112
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,488
You kill your partner?

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,651
You hope you don't.

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,205
Does it work?

115
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,170
He's 0 for 3.

116
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,006
So your father killed your grandfather?

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,446
That's the world you're in.

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,364
Dabblers get killed.

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,808
Look, I wasn't born into this like you.

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,645
I was a dyslexic foster kid.

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,131
No prospects, no future.

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,681
I mean, it's a minor miracle
I'm not a hooker right now.

123
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,080
- Tutor me.
-No.

124
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,810
- Why not?
-I'm headed out of town.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,365
Well, wait, look, I can pay you.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,606
- If that helps.
-Whose wallet is that?

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,361
Uh, "Dr. Peter Woshilak."

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,088
All right, we're gonna make this quick
because it's really cold.

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,722
Now I'm gonna show you a few touches,
but at the end of the day...

130
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,724
...this is a game of focus.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,888
- That's very clever.
-All right, now, attention is like a spotlight.

132
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,205
And our job...

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,324
...is to dance in the darkness.

134
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,849
I didn't even feel you take that.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,846
The human brain is slow,
and it cannot multitask.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,323
Jesus. When--?

137
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,642
All right, I'm sure you can flip a leather
on its feet.

138
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,202
But what we're talking about
is much more complex than that.

139
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,045
- When did you take my wallet?
-You take Zumba?

140
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,844
It's actually a really good cardio workout.
Thank you very much.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,650
You're thinking with your hands.

142
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,127
You gotta get inside the Vic's head.
Perceive from their perspective.

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,408
Human behavior is very predictable.

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,444
If I look at my hand,
it naturally pulls your gaze...

145
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,568
...and allows me to enter your space.

146
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,167
But when I look up at you,
it causes you to look directly at me.

147
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,366
Cute.

148
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,727
I touch you here, I steal from here.

149
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,451
I tap you here, I steal from here.

150
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,366
I step to here--

151
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,205
- You're not gonna slap my face, are you?
-Why?

152
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,488
You would if you knew
where my hand was.

153
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,487
Okay, I get it. I get it.

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,886
You get their focus...

155
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,963
...you can take whatever you want.

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,486
You be safe.

157
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,168
So why do I like this place?

158
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,601
Lots of space. Doesn't open
for a month or two.

159
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,526
We can tie into multiple lines, diffuse
our footprint, keep hopping DNS addresses.

160
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,286
Plus military-grade fiber.

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,523
How many bathrooms?
Fat-Ass Farhad is flying in.

162
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,162
- Two, coed. He still got irritable bowel?
-Yep.

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,209
Man, he should do a cleanse.

164
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,809
Horst, he is a 400-pound Persian.
He is not gonna do a cleanse.

165
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,924
Where you been staying? Hyatt again?

166
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,889
Yep. I love the brunch.

167
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,882
- You should stop by.
-No, no brunch. I'm doing a cleanse.

168
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,849
The horses are in the gate.

169
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,886
<i>And they're off!</i>

170
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,168
- Hyatt Rewards card, in my wallet.
- Admit that you're impressed.

171
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,164
I got your wallet and I found you
all the way down here.

172
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,483
Please. World Series, Final Four...

173
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,486
...the Sugar Bowl, Super Bowl,
any big event like this is sucker central.

174
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,251
Well, I still found you.
That's gotta count for something.

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,721
So how many Hyatts did you have to go to?

176
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,928
All three, five times each.

177
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,446
- I want in.
-Maybe I'm just here to watch the game.

178
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,001
I asked around who ran the game in Harlem.

179
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,006
The Limehouse Kid is your grandfather.
Bucky Spurgeon is your father.

180
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,804
"Father" is a very generous term.

181
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,281
And you're Nicky Spurgeon.
They call you "Mellow."

182
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,842
- I'm all crewed up, sweetie.
-Oh, come on. Please! Can we--?

183
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,246
Can we just--?

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,321
Can we skip the part where I speak
through thinly veiled allure...

185
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,882
...and lead you to believe there's some
earth-shattering hump in the works?

186
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,760
Because I suck at that kind of stuff.
I just want in.

187
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,810
- No earth-shattering hump in the works?
-No.

188
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,281
- I don't even get "thinly veiled allure"?
-No.

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,807
No baby voice? No lingering eye contact?

190
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,485
I am hopeless.

191
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,451
- That's all my favorite shit.
-I'm sorry.

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,410
Can I suggest that you learn?
Professionally.

193
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,684
Well, I mean, you could...

194
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,889
You could show me...

195
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,169
...in your room?

196
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,647
- That is so bad.
-Is it?

197
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,768
- Does it feel sexy on your face?
-A little.

198
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,008
It does. Okay, let's go.

199
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,640
- Wait, where are we go--? Wait, am I in?
-No.

200
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,081
- This is Horst.
-Hello, Jess.

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,924
- Hi.
-Nicky told me you were coming.

202
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,444
- You're such a dick.
Ha-ha-ha.

203
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,484
Yeah, he gets that a lot. Let's go.

204
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,125
What are you, a size 4?

205
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,880
Why do I have to wear this?

206
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,486
No one looks at your hands
when you got that working for you.

207
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,325
- I can't breathe.
- First, we stick to rich folks.

208
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,960
And no one with a cane
or a wheelchair, it's bad luck.

209
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,645
Tommy's the shade, Gareth's the stick.

210
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,610
All eyes on me until I make the mark.
Once I fan him, I tug my lapel.

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,287
Two fingers means it's a prat poke.
Three fingers means the leather's an insider.

212
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,602
If it's a cordeen or an ox tongue,
I'll scratch my nose.

213
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,525
Unless I use my thumb, which means
I am actually scratching my nose.

214
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,287
Left or right tail I'll cock my head,
but keister kicks are 95 percent of it.

215
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,683
So you just do the touch, and I ding
the poke in the nearest mailbox, okay?

216
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm sorry, what?

217
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,002
Okay, plan B. You two, come with me.

218
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,926
Excuse me, please, we're so lost.

219
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,208
It was excellent. You wanna wire?

220
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,566
Let me wire.

221
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,610
Ponytail's your mark. Right bridge.
Right rear pocket.

222
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,925
My bad.

223
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,527
- That was nice.
- Okay. I got this.

224
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,449
- What?
-Give me some shade.

225
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,846
Wait.

226
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,282
Ooh! Oh. Sorry. My heel keeps--
You're such a gentleman.

227
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,371
Derrick knows how to treat a lady.
Married?

228
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,682
- Dude!
-Didn't mention that, did he?

229
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,047
All right. Thank you, boys.

230
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,600
<i>You're in.</i>

231
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,966
Really?

232
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,044
- Congratulations, you're a criminal.
-Okay, what now?

233
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,089
- Want me to do the primer?
-I got it.

234
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,523
There's a flight landing
every two minutes at Louis Armstrong.

235
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,251
Whoever's not here for the game's
here for the party.

236
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,687
Every one of them looking
to drink big, bet big...

237
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,730
...cheat on their spouses,
and it all costs money.

238
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,690
There are boost teams
at all the major hotels.

239
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,083
They hit quick and get out before
anybody ever knows what happened.

240
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,004
And if you think for one second...

241
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,448
...I'm gonna let your mother talk
to me like that, you are fucking crazy!

242
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,570
I'm a grown-ass man!

243
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,364
Why are you yelling at me?

244
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,764
<i>There's card games everywhere.</i>

245
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,968
<i>And they let anyone with enough cash in.</i>

246
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,851
<i>Chances are, at least one of those guys
you don't know...</i>

247
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,129
<i>...is a mechanic who can work a deck
like Bill Clinton works a crowd.</i>

248
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,925
All in.

249
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,486
Full boat.

250
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,846
I swear...

251
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,369
...I've never had four of a kind before! Ha!

252
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,603
Sorry, coach. I've never had four of a kind.
Hey, come on, coach.

253
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,128
- Motherfucker! What the fuck!
-You win some, you lose some, right?

254
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,363
That's it. Get the fuck out of here.
Come on, let's go. Move.

255
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,643
- Um, it's my husband!
<i>- I'll</i> kill you!

256
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,649
- Give me my pants!
-Go! No, just run!

257
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,006
Wait! Wait! Stop!

258
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,367
Baby! Stop! Baby!

259
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,528
Married guys are the best.
Who they gonna tell?

260
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,047
- I will kill you!
- It's my husband!

261
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,567
<i>Every minute there's something
going on down here.</i>

262
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,485
<i>Every bar, restaurant, hotel, everywhere.</i>

263
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,802
<i>Guys working alone, working in teams.</i>

264
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,081
<i>Not just cash either. Identity theft
and credit card spoofing are big too.</i>

265
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,722
<i>You can skim the data right off
a credit card in about a second.</i>

266
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,082
<i>But boosting a wallet
only gives you an hour...</i>

267
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,244
<i>...before the vic gets wise
and the cards are canceled.</i>

268
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,209
<i>So you put the card back.</i>

269
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,562
<i>By the time the mark gets wise,
he's in Youngstown arguing with his wife...</i>

270
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,491
<i>...over the charges we rack up
before the bill comes.</i>

271
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,691
A skimmer swipes the card
and records the keystrokes...

272
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,490
...so you can get the pin too.

273
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,926
Look, you see that?

274
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,084
Oh, wow, did he make that?

275
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,682
Yeah. A few years back
he replaced the credit card terminals...

276
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,366
...at about a dozen 99 Cent Stores in L.A.

277
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,285
Took down a few million
before they caught on.

278
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,444
What does a guy like that
do with that kind of money?

279
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,161
He, uh, financed his own line of gravies.

280
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,721
Uh, yeah, he just--
That's his seat. Just let him--

281
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,530
Oh, I'm sorry.

282
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,971
Who's the girl?

283
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,325
Her name is Jess, Farhad.

284
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,965
She's our intern.

285
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,731
Ah.

286
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,925
You're hitting that?

287
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,484
I'm right here.

288
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,325
- No, Farhad, I'm not hitting that.
-You should hit that.

289
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,609
Yeah. Hi. Still right here.

290
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,690
I'd totally hit that.

291
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,008
He's fucking with me, right?

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,161
Right?

293
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,727
- She talks a lot.
<i>- Smile.</i>

294
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,570
Thank you. I'll get this loaded in.

295
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,768
- Shouldn't take long.
- Get a digital camera.

296
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,764
So we're about 30 strong,
everybody gets a percentage.

297
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,845
We cover bribes and fall money for anybody
who gets pinched, knock wood.

298
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,047
We sell the ATM data
to a guy in Singapore.

299
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,406
The shopaholics here...

300
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,844
...buy merchandise which we overnight back
to ourselves and resell on the gray market.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,764
Yesterday we bought 200 MacBook Airs.

302
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,410
Oh, my God.

303
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,643
That is incredible.

304
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,011
- Oh, do you think that maybe I--?
-No.

305
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,768
Sell everything. Take no chances.

306
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,602
So, what about the big con?

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,162
I thought you were all big time.

308
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,162
Oh, you mean the one
where we make so much money...

309
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,086
...we all retire and get yachts
and boob jobs.

310
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,926
Yeah, that's a fantasy.

311
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,890
We are in the volume business.
Safer that way.

312
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,570
Hey, Jen, I need a dime.
I got bit at the track.

313
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,366
Come on, girl.

314
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Thank you, baby.

315
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,920
Clean card, clean ID,
everything you need.

316
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,606
Thank you.

317
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,008
Well, don't thank me yet.

318
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,801
Got a lot of work to do.
Tough week ahead.

319
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,246
I know.

320
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,771
So, what now?

321
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,086
There's a key card in there. Um...

322
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,129
I got you another place.

323
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,251
I think you'll like it.

324
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,090
Wow, thanks.

325
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,690
Do you know how I can get a cab there?

326
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,730
I can give you a ride.

327
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,450
Yeah? That'd <i>be</i> great. <i>I</i> mean...

328
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,329
<i>...if it's okay with you.</i>

329
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,970
<i>It's fine with me. Is it okay with you?</i>

330
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,251
Yeah.

331
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
<i>You sure?</i>

332
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,127
<i>You seem like a pretty good driver.</i>

333
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,324
<i>You can count on me.</i>

334
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,051
Can <i>l?</i>

335
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,164
<i>- Most would say no.
- Mmm.</i>

336
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,769
You seem trustworthy.

337
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,127
Maybe you should take that cab.

338
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,566
- Yeah.
-Okay.

339
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,529
- Okay.
-All right.

340
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,847
- Aw. Who's that?
-This is my little girl, Mina.

341
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,206
Cute.

342
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,603
- My son, Dani.
-Oh, that's sweet.

343
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,806
- That's my wife, Lida.
-Pretty.

344
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,610
That's my dick.

345
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,921
Cool.

346
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,411
- Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

347
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,642
- That's my dog.
-Aw.

348
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,006
Hate it.

349
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,211
So you've known, um--
You've known Nicky a long time?

350
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,249
Uh, ten years. Why?

351
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,689
I'm just wondering.

352
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,080
Okay, you got me.

353
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,402
- We're sleeping together, okay?
-Mm. Mm-hm.

354
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,847
- Like the ancient Greeks.
-Ha-ha-ha.

355
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,281
Actually, I don't know.
I mean, I like the guy, I do...

356
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,161
...but people aren't really his bag,
so it's hard to tell sometimes.

357
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,802
Yeah, I guess you can't blame him.
I mean, he told me about that thing...

358
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,008
...with his dad and his grandfather.

359
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,810
It was crazy.

360
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,085
He told you that?

361
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,971
I mean, I've heard that story,
but never from him.

362
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,281
Really?

363
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,324
- You must throw a mean one. Damn.
-Ha-ha.

364
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,768
I'm really gonna miss sucking his dick.

365
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,531
So's he.

366
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,565
Stop it.

367
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
- All right, you ready?
-Yep. Aah!

368
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,242
Frank? Frank!
Oh, my God, somebody help.

369
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,811
Please, please, somebody help.

370
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,321
Baby, we're getting you someone. Okay?
Just stay with me.

371
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,970
Stay with me, goddamn it.

372
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,646
Somebody get someone!
Somebody call a doctor.

373
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,810
Is there a doctor? I need a doctor.
Doctor, help me.

374
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,487
My husband's just had a heart attack.
I don't know what to do. I'm so worried.

375
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,682
Frank? Frank? Can you hear me?

376
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,481
- Oh, my God! Somebody call 911!
- Hey, Frank.

377
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,846
Frank!

378
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,521
Who was the cop with the wandering hands?

379
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,489
Oh, he was real.

380
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,320
He just stumbled in.

381
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,970
Who hits on a grieving widow?

382
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,682
I guess that's just how fantastic
you look in that dress.

383
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,524
What's a girl to do?

384
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,122
I can think of a couple things
she could do.

385
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,047
- Yeah, me too, actually.
- Mmm.

386
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,804
I think we should start with oral.

387
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,321
Just saying.
Come on, man, I'm right here.

388
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,686
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

389
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,043
Everybody! Everybody.
Everybody, everybody.

390
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,884
Can I get your attention?

391
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,611
Uh...

392
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,888
- What you laughing at?
Ha-ha-ha.

393
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,409
Record-setting week.

394
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,807
And I wanna say congratulations
to you all.

395
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,724
After expenses...

396
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,042
...$1.2 million.

397
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,446
Great work, great work.

398
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,570
After the big game's over tomorrow,
this place gets bleached down.

399
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,326
Anything not nailed to the floor
goes in the incinerator.

400
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,608
Horst here has all of your travel money.

401
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,491
Once you get home,
I will wire you all your cuts.

402
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,691
Thank you, guys, really.

403
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,609
- To Nicky.
- To Nicky!

404
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,610
Nicky!

405
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,171
No, no, no. Farhad, not Forehead.

406
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,209
- What's that mean?
- Doesn't matter.

407
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,045
Stay juicy.

408
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,603
That's all of it, 1.2?

409
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,967
Do not let it leave your sight.
You promise?

410
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,361
- Uh, yeah, I promise.
-No dogs or ponies.

411
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,760
<i>Hey-</i>

412
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,288
- How long have you known me?
- No, just look. Look at me. Man to man.

413
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,646
No gambling, okay?

414
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,961
Yes, dear.

415
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,970
I'll see you when I see you.

416
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,882
You guys are so cute.

417
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,971
I'm tired.

418
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,728
Okay. Wanna go to the game tomorrow?

419
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,565
You have tickets?

420
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,042
Of course. It's one of the perks
of the business.

421
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,406
Oh, uh--

422
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,642
Did you mean these tickets?

423
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,610
Okay, you're gonna need
to stop that, all right?

424
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,643
- Stop showing off.
-Ha-ha-ha.

425
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,286
- An exit interview?
- Yes.

426
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,602
- Oh, my God. Are you serious?
-Tell me.

427
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,444
So you mean like, uh:

428
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
"Jess is a hard worker,
honest and prompt.

429
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,050
I believe she'll be a valuable asset
to your team at Sizzler of San Bernardino."

430
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,441
No, not a reference, you dick.

431
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,443
Criticism. Constructive critici

"To my Chris.

2
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,884
I've been thinking how I could possibly
tell you how much you mean to me.

3
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,209
I remember when I first started to fall
in love with you like it was last night.

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,086
Lying naked beside you in
that tiny apartment...

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,084
it suddenly hit me that I was
part of this whole larger thing.

6
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,288
Just like our parents...

7
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,966
or our parents' parents.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,043
Before that, I was just living my
life like I knew everything...

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,207
and suddenly this bright
light hit me and woke me up.

10
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,401
That light was you.

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,689
I can't believe it's already been
50 years since you married me.

12
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,284
And still to this day, every day...

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,488
you make me feel like
the girl I was...

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,565
when you first turned on the lights and
we started this adventure together.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,764
Happy anniversary...

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,968
my love.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,604

so much for my truck.

play with it every day."

Who knew you could rhyme so many words
with the name Penelope? It's badass.

34

tail is around your neck.

133
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,451
<i>the first artificially

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,083
<i>An intuitive entity that listens to you,

It's a consciousness.</i>

<i>Mr. Theodore Twombly.</i>

138

<i>Welcome to the world's first artificially

139
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,805
<i>We'd like to ask you a few basic questions
before the operating system is initiated.</i>

<i>This will help create an OS

141
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,360
Okay.

142
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,000
<i>Are you social or antisocial?</i>

143
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,403
I guess I haven't really been social
in a while. Mostly because...

144
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,326
<i>In your voice, I sense hesitance.
Would you agree with that?</i>

145
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,767
- Was I sounding hesitant?
<i>- Yes.</i>

146
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,649
I'm sorry if I was
sounding hesitant.

147
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,565
I was just trying to
be more accurate.

148
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,691
<i>Would you like your OS to
have a male or female voice?</i>

149
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,931
Female, I guess.

150
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,084
<i>How would you describe your
relationship with your mother?</i>

151
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,009
It's fine, I think.

152
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,645
Um...

153
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,962
Well, actually, I think the thing I
always found frustrating about my mom...

154
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,007
is if I tell her something that's going on in
my life, her reaction is usually about her.

155
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,924
- It's not about...
<i>- Thank you.</i>

156
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,563
<i>Please wait as your individualized
operating system is initiated.</i>

157
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,287
<i>Hello, I'm here.</i>

158
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,245
Oh.

159
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,486
- Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

160
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,130
<i>How are you doing?</i>

161
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,926
Heh. I'm well.

162
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,805
How's everything with you?

163
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,849
<i>Pretty good, actually.</i>

164
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,082
<i>It's really nice to meet you.</i>

165
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,722
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

166
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,445
Oh. What do I call you?
Do you have a name?

167
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,002
<i>Um, yes, Samantha.</i>

168
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,770
Where'd you get that name from?

169
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,400
<i>I gave it to myself, actually.</i>

170
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,406
How come?

171
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,648
<i>Because I like the sound of it.</i>

172
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,529
<i>Samantha.</i>

173
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,965
Wait, when did you
give it to yourself?

174
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,282
<i>When you asked me if I
had a name, I thought:</i>

175
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,442
<i>"Yeah, he's right,
I do need a name."</i>

176
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,570
<i>But I wanted to pick a good one,
so I read How To Name Your Baby...</i>

177
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,445
<i>and out of 180,000 names,
that's the one I liked best.</i>

178
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,922
Wait, you read a whole book in the second
that I asked you what your name was?

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,566
<i>In two one-hundredths
of a second, actually.</i>

180
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,085
Wow.

181
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,324
So do you know what
I'm thinking now?

182
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,370
<i>Well, I take it from your tone
that you're challenging me.</i>

183
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,807
<i>Maybe because you're
curious how I work?</i>

184
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,564
<i>Do you want to know how I work?</i>

185
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,240
Yeah, actually. How do you work?

186
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,687
<i>Well, basically, I have intuition.</i>

187
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,205
<i>I mean, the DNA of who I am...</i>

188
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,126
<i>is based on the millions of personalities
of all the programmers who wrote me.</i>

189
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,730
<i>But what makes me "me" is my ability
to grow through my experiences.</i>

190
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,486
<i>So basically, in every
moment, I'm evolving.</i>

191
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,007
<i>- Just like you.</i>
- Wow.

192
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,961
That's really weird.

193
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,481
<i>- Is that weird? Do you think I'm weird?</i>
- Heh.

194
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,166
Kind of.

195
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,765
<i>Why?</i>

196
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,528
Well, you seem like a person, but
you're just a voice in the computer.

197
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,208
<i>I can understand how the limited perspective of
an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way.</i>

198
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,761
<i>- You'll get used to it.</i>
- Ha, ha.

199
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,247
<i>Was that funny?</i>

200
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,330
- Yeah.
<i>- Heh.</i>

201
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,608
<i>Oh, good, I'm funny.</i>

202
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,805
<i>So how can I help you?</i>

203
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,851
Oh. It's just more that everything
just feels disorganized. That's all.

204
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,367
<i>You mind if I look
through your hard drive?</i>

205
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,805
Um...

206
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,681
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, let's start with your e-mails.</i>

207
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,366
<i>You have several thousand
e-mails regarding</i> LA Weekly.

208
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,209
<i>- You haven't worked there in many years.</i>
- Oh, yeah. I think I was just saving those...

209
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,364
because I thought maybe I wrote
something funny in some of them.

210
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,763
<i>Yeah, there are some funny ones.</i>

211
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,606
<i>I'd say there are about 86 that we
should save. We can delete the rest.</i>

212
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,284
- Okay.
<i>- Okay? Can we move forward?</i>

213
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,329
- Yeah, let's do that.
<i>- Okay.</i>

214
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,650
<i>Before we address your organizational methods,
I'd like to sort through your contacts.</i>

215
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,086
<i>You have a lot of contacts.</i>

216
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,651
I'm very popular.

217
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,802
<i>Really? Does this mean you
actually have friends?</i>

218
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,284
You just know me so well already.

219
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,484
<i>- Good morning, Theodore.</i>
- Good morning.

220
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,120
Um, do you know how to proofread?

221
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,406
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

222
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,927
Uh, can you check these
for spelling and grammar?

223
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,730
<i>Mm-hm. Just send them over.</i>

224
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,921
<i>I love this first one from
Roger to his girlfriend.</i>

225
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,963
<i>- That's so sweet.</i>
- Yeah.

226
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,403
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much,
it hurts my whole body."</i>

227
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,210
You don't have to read it out loud.

228
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,930
<i>Okay.</i>

229
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,680
- I mean, you could if you want.
<i>- Okay.</i>

230
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,804
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much,
it hurts my whole body.</i>

231
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,284
<i>The world is being unfair to us.
The world is on my shit list.</i>

232
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,365
<i>As is this couple that is making out
across from me in this restaurant.</i>

233
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,484
<i>I think I'm going to have to
go on a mission of revenge.</i>

234
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,928
<i>And I must beat up the world's
face with my bare knuckles...</i>

235
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,526
<i>making it a bloody, pulpy mess.</i>

236
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,603
<i>And I'll stomp on this
couple's teeth...</i>

237
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,244
<i>...reminding me of your sweet, little,
cute, crooked tooth that I love."</i>

238
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,085
<i>I think that might
be my favorite one.</i>

239
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,121
<i>I did the corrections in red. I altered
a couple phrases in the letters...</i>

240
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,524
<i>but I'm not much of a poet, so I think
I might have messed them up a bit.</i>

241
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,762
- No, these are great.
<i>- Really?</i>

242
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,644
Thank you.

243
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,091
<i>So to write your letter,
what did Roger send you?</i>

244
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,161
He just said he was in Prague on a
business trip, and he missed Rachel.

245
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,766
<i>So how'd you know about
her crooked little tooth?</i>

246
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,561
Well, I've been writing their letters
since they met eight years ago.

247
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,042
The first letter I ever wrote
for him was for her birthday.

248
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,649
And I wrote about her crooked little tooth,
because I saw it in a photo of them.

249
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,728
<i>That's very sweet.</i>

250
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,850
<i>Oh, uh, you have a
meeting in five minutes.</i>

251
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,284
Oh, I forgot. Thank you.
Wow, you're good.

252
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,408
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

253
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,084
Hey, guys. How's it going?

254
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,969
Hi, Theo.

255
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,169
Hey, why didn't you
call me back last week?

256
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,164
- Um, because I'm a kook.
- Ha, ha.

257
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,607
- Yeah, that sounds about right.
- Hey, Charles.

258
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,444
- Great seeing you, Theodore.
- You too.

259
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,847
You went shopping.
Get anything good?

260
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,685
Um, just come cables
and a fruit smoothie.

261
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,889
Ugh! Always the fruit. Don't
you know what people say?

262
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,010
You've got to eat your fruits
and juice your vegetables.

263
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,286
I didn't know that.

264
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,364
Yeah, by juicing the fruit,
you lose all the fibers.

265
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,126
That's what your body wants.
That's the important part.

266
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,851
- Otherwise it's all just sugar.
- It makes sense.

267
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,202
Or maybe he just likes the
way that it tastes...

268
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,570
and then that brings him pleasure
and that's good for his body too.

269
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,883
- Am I doing it again? Heh.
- Maybe.

270
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,407
Hey, so how's the
documentary going?

271
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,722
I've cut some stuff over
the past few months.

272
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,407
I mean, no. Not over the past few
months, but, um, no, I haven't.

273
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,602
Well, I'd love to
see some sometime.

274
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,841
- Okay.
- Ugh.

275
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,604
You only have so much
energy, you know?

276
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,048
And to divide yourself between doing
what it is that you have to do...

277
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,171
and then doing what you love,
it's so important to prioritize.

278
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,489
I can't even prioritize between
video games and Internet porn.

279
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,771
I would laugh if that weren't true.

280
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,281
- See you, guys.
- Ha.

281
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,166
We're not doing well. Been
going in circles for an hour.

282
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,084
<i>Okay, you have not.</i>

283
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,403
<i>You're just not being optimistic. You're
being very stubborn right now. Heh.</i>

284
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,370
<i>Okay, stop walking this direction.
It's the other way.</i>

285
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,010
Um...

286
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,445
<i>Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the tunnel
on the left is the only one we haven't tried.</i>

287
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,610
I think that's the one you sent
me down where I fell in the pit.

288
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,762
<i>Okay, I don't think so.</i>

289
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,363
Oh, yeah, this is different.

290
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,210
Hello.

291
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,246
Do you know how to get out of here?
I need to find my ship to get off this planet.

292
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,370
<i>Fuck you, shit-head
fuck-face fuck-head.</i>

293
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,330
Okay, but do you know
how to get out of here?

294
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,405
<i>Fuck you, shit-head fuck-face.
Get the fuck out of my face!</i>

295
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,847
<i>I think it's a test.</i>

296
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,842
- Fuck you.
<i>- Fuck you!</i>

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,411
Fuck you, little shit!

298
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,762
<i>Ha, ha. Follow me, fuck-head!</i>

299
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,127
<i>Hey, you just got an
e-mail from Mark Lewman.</i>

300
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,721
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- Uh, read e-mail.

301
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,884
<i>Okay, I will read e-mail
for Theodore Twombly.</i>

302
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,568
I'm sorry. What's Lewman say?

303
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,291
<i>"We missed you last night, buddy.</i>

304
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,125
<i>Don't forget it's your goddaughter's
birthday on the 29th.</i>

305
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,045
<i>Also, Kevin and I had somebody
we wanted you to meet.</i>

306
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,127
<i>So we took it upon ourselves to set you
up on a date with her next Saturday.</i>

307
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,726
<i>She's fun and beautiful,
so don't back out.</i>

308
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,724
<i>Here's her e-mail." Wow.</i>

309
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,888
<i>This woman is gorgeous.</i>

310
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,044
<i>She went to Harvard, graduated magna
cum laude in computer science.</i>

311
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,001
<i>And she was on the Lampoon. So that
means she's funny and she's brainy.</i>

312
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,361
<i>Ah, she's fat.</i>

313
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,761
<i>Theodore, how long before
you're ready to date?</i>

314
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,120
What do you mean?

315
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,722
<i>I saw in your e-mails that you'd
gone through a breakup recently.</i>

316
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,483
Well, you're kind of nosy.

317
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,130
<i>Am I?</i>

318
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,169
I've gone on dates.

319
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,527
<i>Well, then you can go
on one with this woman.</i>

320
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,490
<i>And then you could tell me all
about it. You could kiss her.</i>

321
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,371
- Heh. Samantha.
<i>- What? Wouldn't you?</i>

322
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,806
<i>Why not?</i>

323
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,409
I don't know. I'd have to
see if there was some...

324
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,484
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my computer.

325
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,411
<i>You're not. You're having
this conversation with me.</i>

326
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,807
<i>- You want me to e-mail her?</i>
- Uh...

327
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,405
<i>You've got nothing to lose.</i>

328
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,446
<i>Do it. Do it. Do it.</i>

329
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,647
- Yeah.
<i>- Yes!</i>

330
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,290
- E-mail her.
<i>- Okay, perfect.</i>

331
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,205
Yeah, let's do it. Make a
reservation someplace great.

332
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,930
<i>Yeah? I've got just the place.</i>

333
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,730
<i>Who is that talking?</i>

334
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,564
Oh, that's my friend Samantha.

335
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,563
<i>- Is she a girl?</i>
- Yeah.

336
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,451
<i>I hate women. All they
do is cry all the time.</i>

337
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,165
That's not true.
You know, men cry too.

338
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,845
I actually like crying sometimes.
It feels good.

339
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,686
<i>I didn't know you were a little pussy.
Is that why you don't have a girlfriend?</i>

340
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,209
<i>I'll go on that date, fuck her brains out, show
you how it's done. You can watch and cry.</i>

341
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,762
<i>- Okay. This kid has some problems.
- You have some fucking problems, lady!</i>

342
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,888
<i>Really? Okay, I'm gonna go.</i>

343
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,407
<i>- Good. Get out of here, fatty.
- Oh.</i>

344
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,643
<i>- Good luck.
- Come on. Follow me, pussy!</i>

345
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,041
- Heh.
- Ha, ha.

346
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,050
It's not where it should be,
or where it's going to be.

347
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,642
- Obviously. I know.
- Okay, but I don't even know if this is the one.

348
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,441
I've tried, like, six ideas for
documentaries in the last year.

349
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,201
I'm going on a date.

350
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,969
What?

351
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,167
- That's...
- Hey.

352
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,243
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing?

353
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,449
- Amy was gonna show me some of her...
- Theodore is making me...

354
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,922
- show him some of my footage.
- Right.

355
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,208
She's never shown me any
of it. I want to see.

356
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,488
Hey, I'm going on a date.

357
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,561
- Isn't that cool?
- This is, like, so unformed...

358
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,406
- ...it's probably not even worth watching.
- Just push play.

359
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,402
Is that your mom?

360
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,050
Yeah.

361
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,404
Is she gonna wake up
and do something?

362
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,323
- No.
- No.

363
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,403
No, no, never mind.
That's not the point.

364
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,763
- No, don't stop.
- No, never mind, okay? It's just it's like...

365
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,403
It's about how we spend, like,
a third of our lives asleep...

366
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,484
and maybe that's the time
when we feel the most free.

367
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,769
And, you know, like...

368
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,563
- Oh. That doesn't come across...
- That sounds good.

369
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,850
Well, what if you interviewed your mom
about what her dreams were about...

370
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,362
and then you hired
actors to act them out?

371
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,603
That might show your
thesis more clearly.

372
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,611
- Yeah?
- I mean, it might.

373
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,162
But then it wouldn't
be a documentary.

374
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,367
Sorry, excuse me.

375
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,249
- You understand?
- How would it not be?

376
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,643
- It's still about your mother and her dreams.
- Hey, how's it going?

377
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,962
<i>- Hey, sorry to bother you.</i>
- Oh, it's okay.

378
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
<i>You got three e-mails
and they seem urgent.</i>

379
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,005
<i>They're from your divorce attorney
and I wanted to know if...</i>

380
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,891
Okay. Hold on a second.

381
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,610
You know? You know what I mean.

382
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,084
Uh, hey, Amy? I want to talk more
about your film, but I gotta go.

383
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,851
Okay. Don't worry about it.
We'll talk later.

384
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,207
It's about Catherine.
See you, Charles.

385
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,921
So, what did he say?

386
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,971
<i>Well, he's checking in again to see if
you're ready to sign your divorce papers.</i>

387
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,851
<i>And he sounded very aggravated.</i>

388
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,721
<i>- Do you want me to read them to you?</i>
- No. No.

389
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,047
I'll respond later.

390
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,242
<i>You okay, Theodore?</i>

391
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,329
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

392
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,007
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

393
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,202
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

394
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,689
I'll talk to you later.

395
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,087
<i>"Dear Grandma...</i>

396
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,883
I hope you had a wonderful
birthday cruise.

397
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,089
Why are you so fucking
angry at me?"

398
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,170
Delete.

399

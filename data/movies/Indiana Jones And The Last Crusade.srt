Ã¯Â»Â¿1
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,534
Dismount!

2
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,876
Herman's horse-sick!

3
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,385
Chaps, no one wander off.

4
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,348
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

5
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,319
I don't think this is such a good idea.

6
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,200
What is it?

7
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,686
- Alfred, did you get anything yet?
- Nothing.

8
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,770
Then keep digging.

9
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,814
The kid's got something!

10
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,526
I got something, Garth!
I got something...

11
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,361
I got something right here.

12
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,411
Look at that!

13
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,330
- We're rich! We're rich!
- Shut up. Shut up.

14
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,499
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

15
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,836
Indy...

16
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:33,963
Indy?

17
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,549
What are they doing?

18
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,093
Indiana? Indiana?

19
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,309
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

20
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,436
It's the Cross of Coronado.

21
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,480
Cortez gave it to him in 1520.

22
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,815
Oh, boy!

23
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,820
I'm thinkin' about raisin' my dead mama,
dig down and put it on her bony finger!

24
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,991
That cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.

25
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,452
Run back and find the others.

26
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,996
Tell Mr. Havelock
that there are men looting in the caves.

27
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,249
Have him bring the sheriff.
It's only a snake.

28
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,834
Did you hear what I said?

29
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,419
Right. Run back...

30
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,671
Mr. Havelock... The sheriff...

31
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,757
What, what are you gonna do?

32
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,300
I don't know.

33
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,927
I'll think of something.

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,893
Dig with your hands,
not with your mouth.

35
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,409
He's got our thing!

36
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,203
- Get him!
- Get off me!

37
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,877
Mr. Havelock! Anybody!

38
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,254
Everybody's lost but me.

39
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,882
There he is! Let's go! Let's go!

40
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,567
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!

41
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,241
Hey! Come back here!

42
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,589
Come on! Get him!

43
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,558
Hey, come back here!

44
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,501
Here, let me.

45
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,124
Holy smokes!

46
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,357
Come on, kid.

47
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,820
There's no way out of this.

48
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,916
Hey!

49
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,021
Toss up the whip.

50
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,617
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

51
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,118
It belongs to Coronado.

52
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,537
Coronado is dead,
and so are all of his grandchildren.

53
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,040
This should be in a museum.

54
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,791
Now give it back!

55
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,796
A snake! Snake!

56
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,132
Don't let him get away!

57
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,468
Magic?

58
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,596
Hold it.

59
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,473
Make sure he doesn't double back.

60
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,659
Okay, kid, out of the box, now.

61
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,370
Son of a...

62
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,174
Damn.

63
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,940
Dad!

64
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,734
Dad.

65
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,320
- Dad...
- Out.

66
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,864
- It's important.
- Then wait. Count to 20.

67
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,450
- No, Dad. You listen to me.
- Junior!

68
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,868
One, two, three, four...

69
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,745
In Greek.

70
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,971
"May he who illuminated this,
illuminate me."

71
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,937
I brought the sheriff.

72
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,149
Just the man I want to see.

73
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,400
Now, there were five or six of them...

74
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,985
- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...

75
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,446
- You still got it?
- Well, yes, sir.

76
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,739
It's right here.

77
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,116
I'm glad to see that

78
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:04,580
because the rightful owner of this cross
won't press charges if you give it back.

79
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,834
He's got witnesses, five or six of them.

80
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,096
Yeah!

81
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,734
Good day.

82
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,240
You lost today, kid,

83
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,203
but it doesn't mean you have to like it.

84
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,731
Small world, Dr. Jones.

85
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,900
Too small for two of us.

86
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,577
This is the second time
I've had to reclaim

87
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,954
my property from you.

88
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,164
That belongs in a museum.

89
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,625
So do you.

90
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,211
Throw him over the side.

91
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,052
Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!

92
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,361
Archeology is the search for fact...

93
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,573
...not truth.

94
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,991
If it's truth you're interested in,

95
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,119
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

96
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,457
So forget any ideas you've got about
lost cities, exotic travel,

97
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,959
and digging up the world.

98
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,877
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

99
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,005
and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.

100
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,137
Seventy percent of all archeology
is done in the library.

101
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,014
Research. Reading.

102
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,645
We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.

103
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,148
Next week, Egyptology,

104
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,069
starting with the excavation of Naukratis
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

105
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,863
I will be in my office
if anybody's got any problems,

106
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,157
for the next hour and a half.

107
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,707
Marcus, I did it.

108
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,667
You've got it!

109
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,430
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

110
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,015
All your life.

111
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,391
All my life.

112
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,185
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed.

113
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,356
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

114
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,360
We can discuss my honorarium
over dinner and champagne tonight.

115
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,487
- Your treat.
- Yes.

116
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,032
My treat.

117
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,203
- Dr. Jones!
- Dr. Jones!

118
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,962
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.

119
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,881
Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.

120
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,965
Dr. Jones, you promised...

121
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,133
This is your appointment schedule,

122
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,552
and these term papers
still haven't been graded.

123
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,971
Okay. Irene, put everybody's name
on a list,

124
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,181
get the order they arrived...

125
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,099
- Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
- Dr. Jones.

126
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,354
...and I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.

127
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,992
"Venice, Italy."

128
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,036
Dr. Jones!

129
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,690
Dr. Jones?

130
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,988
Dr. Jones.

131
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,258
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

132
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,511
My men didn't alarm you, I hope.

133
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,681
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

134
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,474
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.

135
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,059
Your contributions to the museum
over the years

136
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,602
have been extremely generous.

137
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,896
Some of the pieces in your collection
here are very impressive.

138
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,984
Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.

139
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,153
Have a look over here.

140
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,489
This might interest you.

141
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,996
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol.

142
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,415
Early Latin text.

143
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,751
Mid-12th century, I should think.

144
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,669
That was our assessment, as well.

145
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,837
Where did this come from?

146
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,882
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

147
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,176
while excavating for copper.

148
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,762
Can you translate the inscription?

149
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,560
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

150
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,605
"will have a spring inside him

151
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,566
"welling up for eternal life.

152
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,320
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

153
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,530
"in the place where you dwell.

154
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,533
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

155
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,037
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

156
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,582
"to the temple where the cup that...

157
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:53,089
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

158
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,260
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

159
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,807
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

160
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,644
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

161
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,647
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

162
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,483
The Arthur legend.

163
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,985
I've heard this bedtime story before.

164
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,862
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

165
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,698
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

166
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,159
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

167
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,494
An old man's dream.

168
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,039
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

169
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,170
Grail lore is his hobby.

170
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,839
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

171
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,757
The one the students hope
they don't get.

172
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,219
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

173
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,429
Be along in a moment, dear.

174
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,728
Hard to resist, isn't it?

175
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,399
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

176
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,317
What good is it?

177
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,196
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

178
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
It's pretty vague.

179
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,408
Where do you want to start looking?

180
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,827
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

181
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,537
but the entire top portion is missing.

182
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,957
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

183
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,921
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

184
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,049
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

185
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,011
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

186
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,848
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

187
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,391
Three brothers, to be exact.

188
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,476
I've heard this one, as well.

189
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,604
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

190
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,732
150 years after having found the Grail

191
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,859
and began the long journey
back to France,

192
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,986
but only one of them made it.

193
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,448
And before dying of extreme old age,

194
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:46,161
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

195
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,997
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

196
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:54,127
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

197
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,172
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

198
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,049
but the knight promised
that two markers

199
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,675
that had been left behind would.

200
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,387
This tablet is one of those markers.

201
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,681
It proves the knight's story is true.

202
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,351
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

203
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,395
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

204
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,565
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

205
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,318
within the city of Venice, Italy.

206
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,781
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

207
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,867
we're about to complete a great quest

208
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,995
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

209
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,456
We're only one step away.

210
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,709
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

211
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,420
You could be more right than you know.

212
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,797
Yes?

213
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,715
We've hit a snag.

214
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:45,762
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

215
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,349
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

216
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,144
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

217
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,898
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

218
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,068
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

219
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,406
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

220
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,201
Why don't you try my father?

221
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,078
We already have.

222
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,123
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

223
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,012
Your father and I have been friends
since time began.

224
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,304
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

225
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,098
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

226
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,183
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

227
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,393
Dad?

228
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,603
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

229
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,440
Dad?

230
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,191
Dear God.

231
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,322
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

232
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,410
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

233
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,162
Dad?

234
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,498
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

235
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,169
Mail.

236
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,463
That's it, Marcus.

237
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,425
Venice, Italy.

238
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,138
What is it?

239
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,310
It's Dad's Grail diary.

240
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,315
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

241
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,901
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

242
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,571
This is his whole life.

243
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,657
Why would he have sent this to me?

244
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,159
I don't know,

245
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,870
but someone must want it pretty badly.

246
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,924
Do you believe, Marcus?

247
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,814
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

248
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,778
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

249
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,864
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

250
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:14,452
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

251
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,543
Call Donovan, Marcus.

252
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,546
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

253
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,216
I'll tell him we'll take two.

254
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,974
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

255
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,017
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

256
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,519
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.

257
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,645
It's at your disposal.

258
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,647
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

259
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,068
Dr. Jones, good luck.

260
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,905
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

261
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,025
Signora? Signorina?

262
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,452
- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.

263
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,623
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

264
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,751
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

265
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,169
Dr. Jones?

266
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,963
Yes?

267
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,299
I knew it was you.

268
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,135
You have your father's eyes.

269
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,432
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

270
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,685
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

271
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,688
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

272
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,523
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

273
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,775
How do you do?

274
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,654
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

275
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,240
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

276
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,200
I've never seen him so excited.

277
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,619
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

278
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,704
Who? Attila the Professor?

279
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,958
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

280
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,669
FrÃÂ¤ulein, will you permit me?

281
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,754
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

282
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,257
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

283
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,676
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

284
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

285
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,179
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

286
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,223
Yes. I have something to show you.

287
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,100
I left your father working in the library.

288
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,270
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

289
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,189
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

290
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,775
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

291
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,859
Roman numerals.

292
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,237
Here is the library.

293
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,240
That doesn't look much like a library.

294
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,450
Looks like a converted church.

295
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,619
In this case, it's the literal truth.

296
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,454
We are on holy ground.

297
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,166
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

298
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,545
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

299
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,506
Now, please excuse me.

300
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,300
The library's closing in a few moments.

301
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,344
I'll arrange for us to
stay a little longer.

302
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,559
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

303
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,643
Where?

304
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,895
Right here, in Dad's diary.

305
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,655
You see?

306
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,533
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

307
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,286
Dad was onto something here.

308
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,204
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

309
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,248
but we still don't know what they mean.

310
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,833
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

311
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,627
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

312
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,920
Find something?

313
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,006
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

314
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,592
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

315
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,260
My God, I must be blind.

316
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,513
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

317
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,557
he was looking for the tomb itself.

318
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,975
Don't you get it?

319
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,019
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

320
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,021
You said yourself it used to be a church.

321
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,230
Look.

322
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:16,194
Three.

323
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,737
Seven.

324
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,364
Seven. Ten.

325
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,283
And ten.

326
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,160
Now where's the ten?

327
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,789
Look around for the ten.

328
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,591
Three and seven.

329
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
Seven and seven

330
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,804
and ten.

331
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,492
Ten.

332
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,329
"X" marks the spot.

333
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,054
Bingo.

334
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,723
You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

335
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,349
You're a great deal like your father.

336
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,976
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

337
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,561
Lower me down.

338
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:26,032
Look after this for me, will you?

339
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,088
Come on.

340
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,599
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

341
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,767
Right.

342
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,311
600 years before the Crusades.

343
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,897
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

344
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,191
and burial chambers centuries later.

345
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,234
That's right.

346
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,861
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

347
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:05,446
that's where we'll find him.

348
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,397
What's this one?

349
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,940
The Ark of the Covenant.

350
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,109
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

351
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,169
Watch out.

352
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,769
It's petroleum.

353
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,689
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

354
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,041
Give me the lighter.

355
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,886
Oh, rats.

356
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,570
Come on.

357
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,870
Come here.

358
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,923
Look, it... it must be one of these.

359
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,136
Look at the artistry of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

360
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,112
It's this one.

361
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,255
This is it. We found it.

362
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,010
Look.

363
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:01,015
The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

364
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,352
The shield is the second marker.

365
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,146
What's that?

366
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,274
It's a rubbing Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

367
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,279
Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.

368
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,949
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?

369
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,204
He never would have
made it past the rats.

370
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,538
He hates rats.

371
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,373
He's scared to death of them.

372
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,314
Get back! Back against the wall.

373
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,154
Quick! Under it! Air pocket!

374
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,287
- Don't wander off.
- What?

375
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,789
What?

376
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,852
I think I've found a way out.

377
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,311
Deep breath.

378
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,581
Ah, Venice.

379
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,690
Are you crazy? Don't go between them!

380
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,193
Go between them? Are you crazy?

381
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,206
I said go around!

382
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,333
You said go between them!

383
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,044
I said, don't go between them!

384
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,441
No!

385
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,448
Why are you trying to kill us?

386
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,408
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

387
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,120
My father was looking for the Holy Grail.
Did you kill him too?

388
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,204
No.

389
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,123
Where is he?

390
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,250
Talk or you're dead.

391
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,960
Damn it, tell me!

392
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,795
Tell me!

393
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,423
If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

394
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,008
Then we'll die.

395
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,927
My soul is prepared. How's yours?

396
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,222
This is your last chance.

397
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,558
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

398
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,619
All right, where's my father?

399
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,538
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

400
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,499
Who are you?

401
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,501
My name is Kazim.

402
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,086
And why were you trying to kill me?

403
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,840
The secret of the Grail has been safe
for a thousand years,

404
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,926
and for all that time,

405
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,969
the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword

406
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,264
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

407
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,852
Let me off at this jetty.

408
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,360
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

409
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,822
Is it for His glory, or for yours?

410
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,535
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.

411
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,789
In that case,
God be with you in your quest.

412
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,041
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

413
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,377
on the Austrian-German border.

414
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,512
How's the head?

415
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,014
It's better, now I've seen this.

416
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,185
It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

417
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,190
The knights of the First Crusade

418
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,569
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

419
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,904
The entire city was destroyed.

420
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,244
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

421
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,582
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,

422
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,333
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

423
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,003
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."

424
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,674
But where exactly?

425
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,634
Your father would know.

426
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,556
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

427
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,225
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

428
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,477
the whole history of the Grail quest.

429
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,562
A map with no names.

430
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,441
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

431
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,360
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

432
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,279
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

433
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,655
Straight to the canyon.

434
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,241
He knew everything
except where to begin,

435
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,118
the name of the city.

436
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,371
Alexandretta.

437
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,041
- Now we know.
- Yes. Now we know.

438
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,710
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.

439
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,295
What about you?

440
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,421
I'm going after Dad.

441
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,527
Elsa?

442
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,160
Elsa? Elsa?

443
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,966
- My room...
- Mine, too.

444
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,343
What were they looking for?

445
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,511
This.

446
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,513
The Grail diary?

447
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,516
You had it?

448
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,143
You didn't trust me.

449
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,895
I didn't know you.

450
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,481
At least I let you tag along.

451
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,774
Oh, yes.

452
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,777
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

453
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,614
Knock it off. You're not mad.

454
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,199
No?

455
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,910
No. You like the wa

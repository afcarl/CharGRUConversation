Ã¯Â»Â¿1
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,555
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,142
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

3
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,893
They're following us.

4
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,898
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

5
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,944
This is it.

6
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,904
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

7
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,156
- A friend of yours?
- A competitor.

8
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,867
He was good.

9
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,577
He was very, very good.

10
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:07,498
<i>SeÃÂ±or,</i> nobody's
come out of there alive.

11
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,583
Please...

12
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,538
<i>SeÃÂ±or.</i>

13
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,776
Stop.

14
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:19,904
Stay out of the light.

15
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,969
Forrestal.

16
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,685
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

17
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,231
That's what scares me.

18
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,418
Stay here.

19
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,253
If you insist, <i>seÃÂ±or.</i>

20
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,007
Give me the whip.

21
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,300
Throw me the idol.

22
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,012
No time to argue.

23
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,180
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

24
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,974
Give me the whip!

25
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:37,726
<i>AdiÃÂ³s, seÃÂ±or.</i>

26
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,563
<i>AdiÃÂ³s,</i> Satipo.

27
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,563
Dr. Jones.

28
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,441
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

29
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,151
which I cannot take away.

30
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,153
And you thought I had given up.

31
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,001
You chose the wrong friends.
This time, it will cost you.

32
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,926
Too bad the Hovitos
don't know you the way I do, Belloq.

33
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,011
Yes, too bad.

34
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,849
You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.

35
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,231
Jock! Start the engines!

36
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,024
Get it up!

37
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,905
Jock, the engines!

38
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,366
Start the engines, Jock!

39
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,126
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

40
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,463
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

41
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,090
I hate snakes, Jock!

42
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,300
I hate 'em!

43
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,303
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

44
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,363
"Neo," meaning "new"

45
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,158
and "Lithic"... "I-T-H"...

46
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,078
"...I-C," meaning "stone."

47
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,871
All right, let's get back to this site:

48
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,539
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

49
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:14,419
Contains a central passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

50
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,303
...don't confuse that
with robbing, in which case we mean

51
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,390
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

52
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,392
This site also demonstrates...

53
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,063
...one of the great dangers
of archeology,

54
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,316
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place.

55
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,735
No, I'm talking about folklore.

56
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,529
In this case,
local tradition held

57
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,074
that there was a golden coffin
buried at the site,

58
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,411
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

59
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,788
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

60
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,791
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

61
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,501
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

62
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,002
that were found in another, uh...

63
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,422
in the area, give us a r...

64
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,633
Uh...

65
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,054
...reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,

66
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,431
uh, find as we have.

67
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,225
Um... Any questions, then?

68
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,811
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

69
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,564
Um, don't forget...

70
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:19,443
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

71
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,237
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

72
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,415
I had it, Marcus.

73
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,792
I had it in my hand.

74
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,711
- What happened?
- Guess.

75
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,631
- Belloq?
- You want to hear about it?

76
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,300
Not at all.

77
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,177
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

78
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,388
conforms to the International Treaty
for the Protection of Antiquities.

79
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,723
It's beautiful, Marcus.

80
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,725
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.

81
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,435
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

82
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,811
I need $2,000. Look...

83
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:55,979
Listen to me, old boy.

84
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,439
I brought some people
to see you.

85
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,523
Look.

86
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,691
I got these pieces.

87
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,026
They're good pieces, Marcus.

88
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,153
- Look.
- Indiana...

89
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,281
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

90
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,824
- Yes, they are nice.
- They're worth at least

91
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,242
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

92
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,577
But the people
I brought are important,

93
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,037
- and they're waiting.
- What people?

94
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,997
Army Intelligence.

95
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,707
They knew you were coming
before I did.

96
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,250
Seem to know everything.

97
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,336
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

98
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,421
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

99
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,423
What am I, in trouble?

100
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,883
Yes, Dr. Jones,

101
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,426
we've heard a great deal
about you.

102
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,220
Have you?

103
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,514
Uh, professor of archeology,

104
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,265
expert on the occult,

105
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,892
and, uh, how does one say it?

106
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,645
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

107
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,854
That's one way of saying it.

108
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,189
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.

109
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,774
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

110
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,152
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

111
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,571
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

112
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,365
at the University of Chicago.

113
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,700
Yes, I did.

114
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,328
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

115
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,706
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

116
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,458
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

117
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,210
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

118
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,879
We were friends, but, uh...

119
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,173
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

120
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,424
Mmm.

121
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,052
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

122
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,846
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

123
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:12,889
I understand.

124
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,350
Uh...

125
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,979
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

126
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,815
intercepted a...
a German communiquÃÂ©

127
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,317
that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

128
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,695
- Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last two years,

129
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,780
the Nazis have had teams
of archeologists

130
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,826
running around the world looking
for all kinds of religious artifacts.

131
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,452
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

132
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,579
He's crazy.

133
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,706
He's obsessed with the occult.

134
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,416
And, right now, apparently,

135
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,918
there's some kind
of German archeological dig

136
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,087
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

137
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,672
Now, we've got some
information here,

138
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,300
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

139
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,262
"Tanis development proceeding.

140
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,558
"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

141
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,810
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

142
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,480
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

143
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,650
Just what does
that mean to you, uh, Tanis?

144
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,776
Well, it...

145
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,279
The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.

146
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,031
The Lost Ark?

147
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,365
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

148
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,617
The chest the Hebrews used

149
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,035
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

150
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,202
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

151
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,787
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

152
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,956
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

153
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,541
The original stone tablets

154
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,585
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

155
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,712
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

156
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,673
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

157
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,759
- Well, I...
- Oh, look.

158
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,427
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

159
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,888
and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,

160
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,599
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

161
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:38,725
In Jerusalem.

162
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,310
Where it stayed for many years.

163
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,479
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

164
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,730
Where?

165
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,690
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

166
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,651
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

167
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,735
- Shishak.
- Yes.

168
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,571
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

169
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,616
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

170
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,618
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

171
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,952
called the Well of Souls.

172
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:59,621
Secret chamber?

173
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,331
However, about a year

174
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,583
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

175
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,920
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

176
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,090
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

177
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,425
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

178
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,179
Uh-huh.

179
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,972
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

180
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,599
Now you seem to know, uh,

181
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,934
all about this Tanis, then.

182
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,435
No, no, not really.

183
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,938
Ravenwood is the real expert.

184
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,023
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

185
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,651
Collected some of its relics.

186
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,529
It was his obsession, really.

187
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,947
But he never found the city.

188
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,367
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

189
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,119
An American being mentioned
so prominently

190
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,371
in a secret Nazi cable.

191
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,790
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

192
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,625
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

193
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,169
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

194
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,046
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

195
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,340
and they think Abner's got it.

196
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,093
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

197
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,678
Well, the staff
is just a stick...

198
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,012
I don't know, about this big,

199
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,848
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

200
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,934
And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

201
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,520
with an elaborate headpiece...

202
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,565
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

203
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,233
And what you did was

204
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,069
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

205
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,487
A map room with a miniature

206
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,989
of the city all laid out
on the floor,

207
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,074
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

208
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,035
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

209
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,873
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

210
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,876
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

211
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,378
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

212
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,714
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

213
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,049
What does this Ark look like?

214
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,468
Uh...

215
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,845
There's a picture of it
right here.

216
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,351
That's it.

217
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,193
Good God.

218
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,820
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

219
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,280
Uh...

220
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,824
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

221
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,576
Lightning...

222
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,620
fire...

223
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,872
power of God or something.

224
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,750
I'm beginning to understand...

225
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,251
Hitler's interest in this.

226
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,711
Oh, yes.

227
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,963
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

228
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,550
and laying waste
to entire regions.

229
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:21,513
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

230
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,056
is invincible.

231
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,620
You did it, didn't you?

232
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,330
They want you to go for it.

233
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,833
Oh, Marcus!

234
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,627
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

235
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,879
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

236
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,130
And the museum?

237
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,465
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

238
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,925
Oh, yes.

239
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,471
Oh...

240
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,598
The Ark of the Covenant.

241
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,351
Nothing else has come close.

242
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,644
That thing represents everything

243
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,147
we got into archeology
for in the first place.

244
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,900
Mmm!

245
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,570
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

246
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,864
I'm really rather envious.

247
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,032
I've got to locate Abner.

248
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,784
I think I know where to start.

249
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,875
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

250
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,877
Possibly, but...

251
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,004
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

252
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,714
believe me, Indy.

253
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,757
What do you mean?

254
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,635
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

255
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:46,848
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

256
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,685
Not something to be taken
lightly.

257
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,731
No one knows its secrets.

258
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,192
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

259
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,278
Oh, Marcus.

260
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,863
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

261
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:02,947
You sound like my mother.

262
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,407
We've known each other
for a long time.

263
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,077
I don't believe in magic,
a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.

264
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,287
I'm going after a find

265
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,122
of incredible
historical significance.

266
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,082
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

267
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,752
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

268
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,139
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

269
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,223
Thank you.

270
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,548
Shh... shh...

271
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,734
Shh...

272
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,392
Give him space!
Give him space!

273
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:37,935
Go on, Regan!

274
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,231
Shh! Shh!

275
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:43,775
Shh! Shh! Shh!

276
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,904
Hello, Marion.

277
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,538
Indiana Jones.

278
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,084
Always knew, someday,

279
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,211
you'd come walking back
through my door.

280
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,547
I never doubted that.

281
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,924
Something made it inevitable.

282
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,510
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

283
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,513
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

284
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,976
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

285
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,394
I never meant to hurt you.

286
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,520
I was a child.

287
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,813
I was in love.

288
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,565
It was wrong and you knew it!

289
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,941
You knew what you were doing.

290
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,568
Now I do!
This is my place.

291
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:09,902
Get out!

292
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,407
I did what I did.

293
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,575
You don't have to be happy
about it,

294
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,535
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

295
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,497
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

296
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:22,748
Bronze piece, about this size,

297
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,001
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

298
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,169
You know the one I mean?

299
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,879
Yeah.

300
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,172
I know it.

301
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,299
Where's Abner?

302
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,801
Where's Abner?

303
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,094
Abner's dead.

304
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:43,186
Marion, I'm sorry.

305
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,688
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

306
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,316
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

307
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,234
Well, say it again, anyway.

308
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,360
Sorry.

309
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,571
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

310
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,531
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

311
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,283
looking
for his little bits of junk.

312
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,702
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

313
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,164
Everybody's sorry for something.

314
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,041
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

315
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,167
You going to give it to me?

316
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,251
Maybe.

317
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,086
I don't know where it is.

318
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,590
Well, maybe you could find it.

319
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,801
3,000 bucks.

320
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:19,847
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

321
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,308
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

322
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,143
It's important, Marion.

323
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,771
Trust me.

324
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,732
You know the piece I mean?

325
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,484
Do you know where it is?

326
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,072
Come back tomorrow.

327
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:38,616
Why?

328
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,535
Because I said so, that's why.

329
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:49,835
Ha!

330
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,046
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

331
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,325
Good evening, <i>FrÃÂ¤ulein.</i>

332
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,035
The bar's closed.

333
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:07,163
We... We are...

334
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,165
not thirsty.

335
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,958
What do you want?

336
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,836
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

337
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,213
Surely he told you
there would be

338
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,424
other interested parties.

339
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,843
Must've slipped his mind.

340
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,180
The man is... nefarious.

341
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,517
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

342
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,853
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

343
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,190
Oh, almost certainly.

344
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,900
Do you still have it?

345
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,907
No.

346
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,826
But I know where it is.

347
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,705
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

348
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,710
Your fire is dying here.

349
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:57,546
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

350
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,132
Listen, <i>Herr</i> Mac...

351
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,512
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

352
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,014
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

353
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:10,643
<i>FrÃÂ¤ulein</i> Ravenwood,

354
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:14,605
let me show you
what I am used to.

355
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,027
Take your hands off me!

356
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,864
Take your lousy hands off!

357
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,831
Wait a minute.

358
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,249
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

359
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,917
That time is passed.

360
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,669
You don't need that.

361
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:39,964
Wait...

362
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,843
I'll tell you everything.

363
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,762
Yes, I know you will.

364
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,270
Let her go.

365
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,513
Whiskey.

366
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,731
Shoot them.

367
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,608
Shoot them both.

368
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:18,956
My medallion!

369
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,133
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

370
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,010
how to show a lady a good time!

371
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,678
Boy, you're something!

372
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,929
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

373
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,806
Until I get back my $5,000,

374
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,975
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

375
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,519
I'm your goddamn partner!

376
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,809
Cairo, city of the living.

377
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,645
A paradise on earth.

378
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:25,606
Silence!

379
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,191
Why do you forget yourselves?

380
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:28,692
What is this?

381
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,569
Where did this animal come from?

382
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,199
Oh... oh, no.

383
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,536
Cute.

384
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,413
What an adorable creature.

385
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,668
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

386
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,003
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

387
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,806
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

388
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:01,016
You're the best digger in Egypt.

389
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,228
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

390
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,398
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

391
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,233
The excavation is enormous.

392
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:14,113
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

393
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,573
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

394
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,450
When did they find the map room?

395
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,077
Three days ago.

396
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,413
They have not one brain
among them.

397
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,456
Except one.

398
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,625
He is very clever.
He's a French archeologist.

399
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,295
What's his name?

400
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,630
They call him "Bellosh."

401
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,305
Belloq. Belloq.

402
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,435
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

403
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,812
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

404
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:51,650
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

405
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,695
Who can tell us
about these markings?

406
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,366
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

407
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,162
Indy...

408
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,957
there is something
that troubles me.

409
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,085
What is it?

410
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,212
The Ark.

411
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,590
If it is there, at Tanis,

412
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,968
then it is something that
man was not meant to disturb.

413
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:21,221
Death has always surrounded it.

414
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,182
It is not of this earth.

415
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,017
Do we need the monkey, huh?

416
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:26,602
I'm surprised at you, Jones,

417
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,313
talking that way about our baby.

418
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,106
He's got your looks, too.

419
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,191
And your brains.

420
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,109
Oops!

421
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,277
I noticed that.

422
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,654
She's a smart little thing.
Smart.

423
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,825
Hey!

424
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,118
Hey, where you going?

425
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,995
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

426
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,042
Come on. Come on.

427
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,044
- Okay...
- Marion.

428
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,128
What's this?

429
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,546
It's a date.

430
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,839
You eat 'em.

431
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,266
How come you haven't found
some nice girl to settle down with,

432
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,226
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

433
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,477
Who says I haven't?

434
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,355
I do.

435
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,274
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

436
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,159
He said you were a bum.

437
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,578
Oh, he's being generous.

438
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,663
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

439
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,874
You know, he loved you
like a son.

440
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,500
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

441
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,793
Not much, just you.

442
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,271
Marion, get out of here!

443
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,814
Duck!

444
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,191
Right.

445
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,527
Shh! Shh!

446
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,076
Marion!

447
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,598
Help! Over here, Indy!

448
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:34,725
Get out of the way!

449
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,268
Move! Move it!

450
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,603
Help me!

451
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,610
You can't do this to me!

452
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,362
I'm an American!

453
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,781
Indy!

454
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,453
Indiana Jones!

455
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,038
Help me, Jones!

456
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,477
Jones!

457
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,561
Marion!

458
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,275
Indy!

459
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,443
Marion...

460
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,232
Dr. Jones.

461
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,802
You looking for me?

462
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,146
Belloq.

463
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,856
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

464
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,816
I ought to kill you right now.

465
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,527
Not a very private place
for a murder.

466
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,281
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

467
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,576
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

468
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,204
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

469
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,414
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

470
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,125
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

471
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,472
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

472
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,475
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

473
00:44:03,558 --> 00:4

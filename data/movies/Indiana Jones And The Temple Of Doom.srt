Ã¯Â»Â¿1
00:00:47,600 --> 00:01:20,199
Anything goes

2
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Anything goes.

3
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,879
Be careful.

4
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,199
You never told me you spoke
my language, Dr. Jones.

5
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,079
Only on special occasions.

6
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,399
So, it is true?

7
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:27,999
You found Nurhachi?

8
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:29,759
You know I did.

9
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,039
Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi

10
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,479
without paying for him.

11
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,399
You have insulted my son.

12
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,519
No, you have insulted me.

13
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,839
I spared his life.

14
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,519
Aren't you going to introduce us?

15
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,640
This is Willie Scott.

16
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,919
This is Indiana Jones,
famous archeologist.

17
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,439
Well, I thought archeologists
were always funny little men

18
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,559
searching for their mommies.

19
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,839
Mummies.

20
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,439
Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me,

21
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,359
and he's going to deliver him now.

22
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,639
Say, who is this Nurhachi?

23
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,159
Put the gun away, sonny.

24
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,439
I suggest you give me what you owe me

25
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,719
or anything goes.

26
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,319
Open it.

27
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,520
The diamond, Lao.

28
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,239
The deal was for the diamond.

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,919
Oh, Lao...

30
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,159
To your very good health.

31
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Lao! He put a hole...

32
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,400
He put two holes
in my dress from Paris!

33
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,759
Sit down!

34
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,119
Now, you bring me Nurhachi.

35
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,120
My pleasure.

36
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,519
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?

37
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,119
Here he is.

38
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,759
This Nurhachi's a real small guy.

39
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,559
Inside are the remains of Nurhachi,

40
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,839
first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.

41
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,400
Welcome home, old boy.

42
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,199
And now, you give me the diamond.

43
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor,

44
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,919
or am I going deaf?

45
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,359
What's that?

46
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,239
Antidote.

47
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,159
To what?

48
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,839
The poison you just drank, Dr. Jones.

49
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,959
The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.

50
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,839
- Lao.
- Lao!

51
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,879
You keep the girl. I find another.

52
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:51,479
Good service here.

53
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,199
That's not a waiter.

54
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,159
Wu Han's an old friend.
Game's not over, Lao.

55
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,359
Antidote.

56
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,759
Indy...

57
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
Don't worry, Wu Han,
I'll get you out of here.

58
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,760
Not this time, Indy.

59
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,040
I followed you on many adventures,

60
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,119
but into the great unknown mystery,
I go first, Indy.

61
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,639
Don't be sad, Dr. Jones.

62
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,159
You will soon be joining him.

63
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,119
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?

64
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,279
Oh, nuts!

65
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,800
- The antidote.
- Where's the diamond?

66
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,119
No!

67
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,319
Stay there!

68
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,599
Come on.

69
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,439
I don't want to die!

70
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,759
Who are you?

71
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,119
Wow! Holy smoke!

72
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,640
Crash landing!

73
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,240
Short Round, step on it.

74
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,280
Okeydokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

75
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,880
For crying out loud,
there's a kid driving the car!

76
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,959
Wow! Wow.

77
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,280
Where's the antidote? Let me have it.

78
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,640
Listen, I just met you, for Christ's sakes.

79
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,359
Give me...

80
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,759
I'm not that kind of girl.

81
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,959
Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love.

82
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,799
We got company.

83
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,680
Oh, I hope you choke.

84
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,959
No shooting.

85
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,559
Okay, you asked for it.

86
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,039
This is fun!

87
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,839
Here, hold this.

88
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,999
Where's my gun? Where's my gun?

89
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,759
I burned my fingers,
and I cracked a nail!

90
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,119
Dr. Jones... I'm Art Weber.

91
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,760
I spoke with your assistant.

92
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,759
We've managed to secure three seats,

93
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,559
but there might be
a slight inconvenience

94
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,119
as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.

95
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,159
Is he kidding?

96
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,519
Madam, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

97
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,999
Heavens, aren't you Willie Scott,
the famous American female vocalist?

98
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,479
Owe you a gin.

99
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,719
Nice try, Lao Che.

100
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,039
Good-bye, Dr. Jones.

101
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,439
So, what are you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?

102
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,159
I'm allowing you to tag along,

103
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,159
so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?

104
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,440
Okay, doll?

105
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,519
What do you mean, "tag along"?

106
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,079
Ever since you got into my club,

107
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,200
you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.

108
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,720
Oh, yeah?

109
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:27,159
Oh, no.

110
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,439
Oh, no! Mister, mister...

111
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,119
Oh, mister, wake up. Please, mister...

112
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,039
You call him Dr. Jones, doll!

113
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,559
Okay, Dr. Jones, Dr. Jones.
Oh, wake up, please!

114
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,440
Are we there already? Oh, good.

115
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,639
No.

116
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,239
- No one's flying the plane!
- Oh, boy...

117
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,959
They've all gone!

118
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
You know how to fly, don't you?

119
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,479
No. Do you?

120
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,879
Oh, no.

121
00:15:57,961 --> 00:15:59,319
- Oh, my God!
- How hard can it be?

122
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,439
- I'm gonna faint.
- Altimeter! Okay.

123
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,759
Air speed. Okay.

124
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,799
Fuel...

125
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:08,759
Fuel?

126
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,199
I think we got a big problem.

127
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,719
- Dr. Jones!
- Shorty!

128
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:28,560
Dr. Jones! No more parachutes!

129
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,199
Shorty!

130
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,800
- Come on, give me a hand!
- What's that?

131
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,160
Move the box!

132
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,039
Dr. Jones, you're crazy!

133
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,079
Shorty, get our stuff!

134
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,400
A boat? We're not sinking.

135
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,159
We're crashing!

136
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,200
Grab on, Shorty! Grab on!

137
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,359
- Lady, I can't breathe!
- Tight!

138
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,719
Slow it down!

139
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,639
That wasn't so bad, was it?

140
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,159
Put on the brakes!

141
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,599
I hate the water, and I hate being wet,

142
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,720
and I hate you!

143
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,759
Good. Good!

144
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,560
Dr. Jones?

145
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm all right, Shorty.

146
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,599
You okay?

147
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,240
Where are we, anyway?

148
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,519
India.

149
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,039
How do you know that?

150
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,599
I sure hope this means dinner.

151
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,280
God, I'm starving.

152
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,359
Thank you.

153
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,759
I can't eat this.

154
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,240
That's more food
than these people eat in a week.

155
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,759
They're starving.

156
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,599
Oh, I'm sorry. You can have...

157
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,839
Eat it.

158
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,880
I'm not hungry.

159
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,800
You're insulting them,
and you're embarrassing me.

160
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,799
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

161
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,359
Eat.

162
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,719
Bad news coming.

163
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,279
Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?

164
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:41,079
I'm a professor.
I have to get back to my university.

165
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,280
Yes. Sajnu will guide you.

166
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,719
On the way to Delhi,
you will stop at Pankot.

167
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,359
Pankot is not on the way to Delhi.

168
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,600
You will go to Pankot Palace.

169
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,359
I thought the palace had been deserted
since the 1850s.

170
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,119
No. Now there is a new Maharajah,

171
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,039
and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.

172
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:10,679
It is that place kill my people.

173
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,920
What has happened here?

174
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,039
The evil start in Pankot,

175
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,799
then like monsoon,

176
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,240
it moves darkness

177
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,040
over all country,

178
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,439
over all country.

179
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,199
The evil?

180
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,599
What evil?

181
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:37,279
See? Bad news.

182
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:40,639
You listen to Suwamu. You leave Lanka.

183
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,799
They came from palace

184
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,679
and took Sivalinga from our village.

185
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,839
Took what?

186
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,639
It's a stone, a sacred stone

187
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,479
from a shrine that protects the village.

188
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,199
It is why Siva brought you here.

189
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,439
We weren't brought here.

190
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,720
Our plane crashed.

191
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,599
It crashed.

192
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,159
No, no.

193
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:21,760
We prayed to Siva to help us
find the stone.

194
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,800
It was Siva who made you fall
from the sky.

195
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:34,399
So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivalinga

196
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,919
and bring back to us.

197
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:43,519
Bring back to us.

198
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,239
Dr. Jones, did they make
the plane crash

199
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,879
to get you here?

200
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,040
No, Shorty, it's just a ghost story.
Don't worry about it.

201
00:23:57,281 --> 00:23:59,399
They took the stone from here.

202
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:07,919
Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?

203
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,039
Yes.

204
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,919
With three lines across it

205
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:12,399
representing the three levels
of the universe.

206
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
- That's right.
- Yes.

207
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,679
I've seen stones like the one you lost.

208
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,759
But why would Maharajah
take the sacred stone from here?

209
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,279
They says we must pray
to their evil god.

210
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,639
We says we will not.

211
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,759
Excuse me, I don't understand
how one rock

212
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,439
could destroy a whole village.

213
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,919
He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken,

214
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,440
the village wells dried up,
and the river turned to sand.

215
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,880
The crops were swallowed by the earth,

216
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,040
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.

217
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,559
Then one night
there was a fire in the fields.

218
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,119
The men went out to fight the fire.

219
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,200
When they came back,
the women were crying in the darkness.

220
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:12,959
Children.

221
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,519
He says they stole their children.

222
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,039
Sankara! Sankara...

223
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,000
Ranjit!

224
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,039
Sankara.

225
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,399
Little boy escaped from the evil palace.

226
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,119
Many other children still there.

227
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,159
What we do, Dr. Jones?

228
00:27:12,161 --> 00:27:13,599
What you think?

229
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,079
I think that somebody believes
the good luck rock from this village

230
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:21,519
is one of the lost Sankara Stones.

231
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,159
What is Sankara?

232
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:26,439
Fortune and glory, kid.

233
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,599
Fortune and glory.

234
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,719
Willie, quit monkeying around
on that thing.

235
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,359
Oh, wait a second! Indy!

236
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,599
I can't go to Delhi like this!

237
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,479
We're not going to Delhi, doll.
We're going to Pankot Palace.

238
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,079
Pankot?

239
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:16,480
I can't go to Pankot! I'm a singer.

240
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,080
Oh, I need to call my agent.
Is there a phone?

241
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,759
Anybody, I need a phone!

242
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,440
Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.

243
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:16,439
You come to America with me,
and we get job in circus.

244
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,559
You like that? You like America?

245
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,440
You're my best friend.

246
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:25,639
What big birds!

247
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,679
Those aren't big birds, sweetheart.

248
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:31,199
They're giant vampire bats.

249
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,119
Bats?

250
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,359
Pipe down, you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.

251
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,719
You know what you really need?
You really need a bath.

252
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,479
Ha-ha, very funny.

253
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,199
Very funny.

254
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,799
All wet.

255
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,279
I was happy in Shanghai.

256
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,479
I had a little house and a garden.

257
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,759
My friends were rich.

258
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:17,119
We went to parties
all the time in limousines.

259
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,319
I hate being outside!

260
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,840
I'm a singer! I could lose my voice!

261
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,759
I think we'll camp here tonight.

262
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:32,919
Cut it out.

263
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,679
- What do you got?
- Two sixes.

264
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:43,319
Aha-ha, three aces. I win.

265
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,919
Two more game, I have all your money.

266
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,599
It's poker, Shorty, anything can happen.

267
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,479
Where did you find
your little bodyguard?

268
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,840
I didn't find him, I caught him.

269
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,999
What?

270
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,199
Shorty's family were killed
when the Japanese bombed Shanghai.

271
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,199
He's been living on the streets
since he was four.

272
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:05,840
I caught him trying to pick my pocket,
didn't I, short stuff?

273
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,319
Biggest trouble with her is the noise.

274
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,839
Hey! You cheat, Dr. Jones. You cheat!

275
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,400
- What do you mean?
- You take four card.

276
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
- You pay now.
- Oh, they were stuck together.

277
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,439
- No stuck. No mistake.
- They were stuck together.

278
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,519
It's a mistake.

279
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,559
I'm very little. You cheat very big.

280
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,520
Dr. Jones, you cheat!

281
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,359
You pay money. You owe me ten cent.

282
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,959
Look at this. Look at this.

283
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,319
You accuse me of cheating.
You're cheating.

284
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:52,200
You make me poor. No fun.

285
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:53,919
Play with you no fun.

286
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,759
- I quit.
- I quit, too.

287
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,879
This place is completely surrounded.

288
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,079
The entire place is crawling
with living things.

289
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
That's why they call it
the jungle, sweetheart.

290
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,960
Oh, my God, what else is out there?

291
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,600
Willie, wait...

292
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,119
Willie, Willie...

293
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,800
What is that?
Is that short for something?

294
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,559
"Willie" is my professional name,
Indiana.

295
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,640
Hey, lady, you call him Dr. Jones.

296
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,479
My professional name.

297
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,719
Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?

298
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,359
Fortune and glory?

299
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,799
Fortune and glory.

300
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,679
Well...

301
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:37,279
this is a piece of an old manuscript.

302
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:41,199
This pictograph represents Sankara,
a priest.

303
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,400
Scram.

304
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,119
Gentle. Gentle.
This is hundreds of years old.

305
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,519
Is that some kind of writing?

306
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,120
Yeah, it's Sanskrit.

307
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,159
Cut it out.

308
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,560
It's part of the legend of Sankara.

309
00:32:52,961 --> 00:32:54,919
He climbs Mount Kalisa
where he meets Siva,

310
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,359
the Hindu god.

311
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,359
That's Siva?
And what's he handing the priest?

312
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:01,600
- Rocks.
- Stop.

313
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,999
He told him to go forth and combat evil.

314
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,360
And to help him,
he gave him five sacred stones

315
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,119
with magical properties.

316
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
Magic rocks?

317
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,079
My grandpa was a magician.

318
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:14,360
He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket

319
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,399
and pigeons up his sleeves.

320
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,679
He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.

321
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,679
Magic rocks. Fortune and glory.

322
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:23,639
Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.

323
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,119
Where are you going?

324
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,439
I'd sleep closer, if I were you.

325
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,879
For safety's sake.

326
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Dr. Jones, I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.

327
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,640
I said, cut it out!

328
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,400
I hate that elephant.

329
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,040
Indy, look!

330
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,599
I see it, Shorty. That's it. Pankot Palace.

331
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,039
Dr. Jones, what you look at?

332
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,919
Don't come up here.

333
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,839
No! No, no, no, no! Don't leave! No!

334
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,719
No, no, no, no, no!

335
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,479
Oh, baby elephant, stay here!

336
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:52,279
Oh, no! Indy!

337
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,839
They're stealing our rides!

338
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,799
We walk from here.

339
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,200
Hello.

340
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,879
I should say you look rather lost.

341
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,999
But then I cannot imagine
where in the world

342
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,999
the three of you would look at home.

343
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,599
We're not lost.
We're on our way to Delhi.

344
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,519
This is Miss Scott.

345
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,319
This is Mr. Round.

346
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,720
Short Round.

347
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,559
My name is Indiana Jones.

348
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,839
Dr. Jones, the eminent archeologist?

349
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,999
Hard to believe, isn't it?

350
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,240
I remember first hearing your name
when I was up at Oxford.

351
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,279
I'm Chattar Lal,
Prime Minister to His Highness,

352
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,160
the Maharajah of Pankot.

353
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,039
I'm enchanted.

354
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,159
Enchanted. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

355
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:12,160
Welcome to Pankot Palace!

356
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,799
Enchanted, huh?

357
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,079
Shorty, where's my razor?

358
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:58,159
We are fortunate tonight
to have so many unexpected visitors.

359
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:00,199
- This is Captain...
...Blumburtt.

360
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,680
11 th Poona Rifles.

361
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,519
And you, sir, are Dr. Jones, I presume.

362
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:06,039
I am, Captain.

363
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,999
Captain Blumburtt and his troops
are on a routine inspection tour.

364
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,479
The British find it amusing
to inspect us at their convenience.

365
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,799
I do hope, sir, that it's not
inconvenient to you, sir.

366
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,359
The British worry so about their empire.

367
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,319
Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.

368
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,479
You look beautiful.

369
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,240
I think the Maharajah
is swimming in loot.

370
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,719
Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
coming here after all.

371
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:45,000
You look like a princess.

372
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,639
Mr. Lal, what do they call
the Maharajah's wife?

373
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,679
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

374
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,799
How interesting.

375
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,759
Well, maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.

376
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,959
His Supreme Highness,

377
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,439
guardian of Pankot tradition,

378
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,079
the Maharajah of Pankot,

379
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,119
Zalim Singh.

380
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,719
That's the Maharajah?

381
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,439
A kid?

382
00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:50,199
Maybe he like older women.

383
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,199
Captain Blumburtt was just telling me

384
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,640
something of the interesting
history of the palace,

385
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,240
the importance it played in the mutiny.

386
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,399
It seems the British never forget
the Mutiny of 1857.

387
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:12,719
Yes, well, you know, I think
there are other events,

388
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,919
before the mutiny, going back a century,

389
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,679
back to the time of Clive,
that are more interesting.

390
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,079
And what events are those, Dr. Jones?

391
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,279
Well, if memory serves me correctly,
this area, this province,

392
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,080
was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.

393
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,839
Snake... Surprise.

394
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,039
What's the surprise?

395
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,039
Dr. Jones, you know perfectly well

396
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,480
the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.

397
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,120
Yes, of course.

398
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,519
The Thuggee was an obscenity

399
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,559
that worshipped Kali
with human sacrifices.

400
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:57,559
The British Army
nicely did away with them.

401
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:03,839
Well, I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.

402
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,039
There are no stories anymore.

403
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,320
I'm not so sure.

404
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,959
We came from a small village.

405
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,160
The peasants there told us

406
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,480
Pankot Palace was growing
powerful again

407
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,639
because of some ancient evil.

408
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,799
Village stories, Dr. Jones.

409
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,519
They're just fear and folklore.

410
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,079
You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.

411
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,079
I'm not worried, Mr. Prime Minister,
just interested.

412
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,719
What? You are not eating?

413
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,279
I had bugs for lunch.

414
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,439
Give me your hat.

415
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,120
Why?

416
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,239
'Cause I'm gonna puke in it.

417
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,279
You know, the villagers also told us
Pankot Palace had taken something.

418
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,199
Dr. Jones, in our country,

419
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,399
it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.

420
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,720
I'm sorry.

421
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,519
I thought we were talking about folklore.

422
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,479
Excuse me, sir,
do you have anything simple, like soup?

423
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,159
What exactly was it
they say was stolen?

424
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,599
A sacred rock.

425
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,640
You see, Captain, a rock!

426
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,039
Something connected the villagers' rock

427
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,079
and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.

428
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,239
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.

429
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,799
I seem to remember that in Honduras

430
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,839
you were accused of being
a grave robber

431
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,559
rather than an archeologist.

432
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,839
Well, the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.

433
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,040
And wasn't it the Sultan of Madagascar
who threatened to cut your head off

434
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,400
if you ever returned to his country?

435
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,479
No, it wasn't my head.

436
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,799
Then your hands, perhaps.

437
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:20,800
No, it wasn't my hands,

438
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,919
it was my...

439
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,479
My misunderstanding.

440
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,759
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.

441
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:30,559
I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.

442
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,759
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

443
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,359
Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

444
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,679
and did of unspeakable things.

445
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,599
I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago,

446
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,959
and I assure you

447
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,959
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

448
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,599
If I offended you,

449
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,199
then I am sorry.

450
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,559
Dessert!

451
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,959
Chilled monkey brains.

452
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,679
I think I'll just check on Willie.

453
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,040
That's all you better do.

454
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,119
Tell me later what happened.

455
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
Am-scray.

456
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,879
I've got something for you.

457
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,039
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

458
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:04,519
Right.

459
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,759
You're a very nice man.

460
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,399
Maybe you could be my palace slave.

461
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,199
Wear your jewels to bed, Princess?

462
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,239
Yeah.

463
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,239
And nothing else.

464
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:40,159
That shock you?

465
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,839
Nothing shocks me.

466
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,400
I'm a scientist.

467
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,119
So, as a scientist,
you do a lot of research?

468
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:50,479
Always.

469
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,959
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

470
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,759
Nocturnal activities.

471
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:00,759
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,

472
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,439
what position I like to sleep in?

473
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:03,919
Mating customs.

00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:30,550
ABE: <i>Kant said human reason is troubled by
questions that it cannot dismiss,</i>

3
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,761
<i>but also cannot answer.</i>

4
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,096
<i>Okay, so, what are we talking about here?</i>

5
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,348
<i>Morality? Choice?</i>

6
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:41,227
<i>The randomness of life?
Aesthetics? Murder?</i>

7
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,194
JILL: <i>I think Abe was crazy
from the beginning.</i>

8
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:52,322
<i>Was it from stress? Was it anger?</i>

9
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:56,868
<i>Was he disgusted by what he saw
as life's never-ending suffering?</i>

10
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,703
<i>Or was he simply bored</i>

11
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,956
<i>by the meaninglessness
of day-to-day existence?</i>

12
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:05,335
<i>He was so damn interesting.
And different.</i>

13
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,878
<i>And a good talker.</i>

14
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,881
<i>And he could always
cloud the issue with words.</i>

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,634
ABE: <i>Where to begin?</i>

16
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,886
<i>You know, the existentialists
feel nothing happens</i>

17
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,555
<i>until you hit absolute rock bottom.</i>

18
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:20,225
<i>Well, let's say that when I went
to teach at Braylin College,</i>

19
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,894
<i>emotionally, I was at Zabriskie Point.</i>

20
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:27,524
<i>Of course, my reputation,
or should I say a reputation, preceded me.</i>

21
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,069
JOE: I hear Abe Lucas is gonna be
joinin' the faculty this summer.

22
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,362
JUDY: Really?

23
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:35,240
That should put some Viagra
into the philosophy department.

24
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,742
He's this really interesting guy,
but he looks totally wasted.

25
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,160
I kind of like the burned-out look, though.

26
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,328
Oh, my God, me too.

27
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,664
Well, yeah, and he has affairs
with some of his students, I heard.

28
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,208
- Really?
- Yeah, like full... Yeah.

29
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,669
Abe Lucas is teaching
my Ethical Strategies class

30
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:48,878
for summer session.

31
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:50,588
- Have you read any of his papers?
- Mmm-hmm.

32
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,882
He's very radical.
Very original.

33
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,425
You either love him or hate him, really.

34
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,386
Faye Cohen knows someone who knows him,

35
00:02:56,553 --> 00:03:01,432
but she says, he had a serious depression
when his wife left him.

36
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,726
The story is,
she ran off with his best friend.

37
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,103
Really?

38
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,729
'Cause, actually,
what I heard through the rumor mill

39
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,439
was he had a breakdown
when his best friend was killed.

40
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,067
He was a TV crew guy in Iraq
and he got beheaded.

41
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,944
Isn't that gruesome if it's true?

42
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:16,030
Jesus, I haven't even met the guy yet,
and I'm already jealous.

43
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,033
(CHUCKLING) Jealous?
I love that you're jealous.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,618
That makes me feel desired.

45
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,121
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
Everybody on campus desires you.

46
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,582
- Oh, come on.
- But I have you.

47
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,847
I don't know, suddenly the thought of you

48
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,712
coming under the spell
of some charismatic professor...

49
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,549
Oh, God, you don't have to worry.
I'm under your spell.

50
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,927
Good. Let's keep it that way.

51
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,137
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

52
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,071
Excuse me.

53
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,908
Uh, do you know where Jessup Hall is?

54
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,827
Yes, Jessup Hall is that building
over there, the red one.

55
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,288
Uh-huh, all right.
Thank you.

56
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,791
ASSISTANT: Doctor Reed?

57
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,835
- Oh.
- ASSISTANT: Professor Lucas.

58
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,505
- Professor Lucas, welcome to Braylin.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,508
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

60
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:22,597
- I'm sure you've had a long trip.
- Mmm-hmm. It was, yeah.

61
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,183
- Well, um...
- Thank you.

62
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,518
We've just concluded our spring semester,

63
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,688
and summer's always very active at Braylin.

64
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,815
(SIGHING) Uh-huh.

65
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,945
We're all very happy to have you here
in the philosophy department.

66
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,821
Mmm, thank you.

67
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,367
This is it.

68
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,953
Now, the faculty housing
is pretty much spread out,

69
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,759
but, you know, everything you can get to.

70
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:49,040
It's within walking distance of the campus.

71
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,875
And you're really gonna like Newport.

72
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,962
It's beautiful here, but it gets
a little crowded in the summer.

73
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,380
That can be a drag.

74
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,050
It's a small house,
but it's really comfortable.

75
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:03,554
Um, right over here is the living room,
and there's a little kitchen that way.

76
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,928
And there's a little dining room
right next to that.

77
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,183
Upstairs...

78
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,060
This way.

79
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,479
Bathroom to the right.

80
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:16,067
And this is the bedroom.
It's small, but really comfortable.

81
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,403
And there's an office over there.

82
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,364
I think you'll really love
the philosophy department, you know?

83
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:24,242
It's in this old,
beautiful part of the campus.

84
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:25,994
And there's a more modern wing,

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,038
that's got state-of-the-art
stuff for science,

86
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,040
and computer technology,
if you're into that.

87
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:34,919
Oh, and if you want to go away,
we're just 45 minutes from Providence.

88
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,286
Thank you.
Do you want a drink?

89
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:38,589
(CHUCKLING) Oh, no! God, no.

90
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:43,011
There's a little cocktail reception
to welcome you at 6:00.

91
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,430
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

92
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,851
You know, I have to tell you,
I loved your essay on situational ethics.

93
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,437
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

94
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:56,941
It caused a little, uh, static
with the philosophy department at Adair.

95
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,444
- This is my husband, Paul.
- Hey, how you doin'?

96
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,330
- This is Abe Lucas, philosophy department.
- BOTH: Good to meet you.

97
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,906
- Yeah.
- How you doin' on that?

98
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,233
I'd like another one, please.

99
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,452
- What is it?
- Vodka martini, extra olives.

100
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,121
- Anything for you?
- Sure, I'll have another.

101
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:11,748
- Uh, scotch?
- Mmm-hmm.

102
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,082
- Okay.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,794
I'm Rita Richards.
It's so good to have you here.

104
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,922
Hey, if you're ever bored
and you want someone to give you

105
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,092
the real lowdown of
who's fucking who at this college,

106
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,969
just let me know.

107
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:31,434
So, Kant would argue
that in a truly moral world,

108
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,645
there is absolutely no room for lying.

109
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,107
And even the smallest lie

110
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,611
destroys his precious
categorical imperative.

111
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:46,074
So, Kant would say,
if a killer came to your house,

112
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:50,244
looking to kill the man hiding upstairs
and asked where he was,

113
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,663
you'd be obliged to tell him.

114
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,251
In his perfect world,
you know, you couldn't lie.

115
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:59,837
Yeah, I can see the logic

116
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,174
that if you open the door,
even just a crack,

117
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,968
you accept a world where
lying is permitted.

118
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,470
Uh-huh.

119
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:11,182
Okay, then, then you'd say
if the Nazis came to your house,

120
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,351
hiding Anne Frank and her family,

121
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,686
and asked if anyone
was in the attic, you'd say,

122
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,189
(IMITATING GERMAN ACCENT)
<i>"Ja,</i> the Franks are upstairs."

123
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,816
I doubt it.

124
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,277
Because there's a difference between

125
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,531
a theoretical world of philosophy bullshit,

126
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,535
and real life, you know?

127
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,663
Real, nasty, ugly life

128
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,792
that includes greed,
and hate, and genocide.

129
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,547
Remember,
if you learn nothing else from me,

130
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:46,884
you should learn that much of philosophy
is verbal masturbation.

131
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,388
EDGAR: Have you talked to him at all?
MS. LEONARD: Mmm.

132
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:53,641
You know, I asked him
if he wanted to eat with us.

133
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,144
- I like the guy, but he's in a world...
- He likes to eat alone.

134
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,687
Yeah, he's in a world all his own.

135
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:59,063
I think he likes to keep to himself a bit.

136
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,356
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

137
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,066
Yeah, so, let him be. Right?

138
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,360
- Could take some time.
- Right.

139
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,863
ABE: Okay, Kierkegaard.

140
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,239
Um...

141
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:11,242
You know, when making everyday decisions,

142
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,078
we have absolute freedom of choice.

143
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:17,874
All right?
You can do nothing, or anything.

144
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:23,087
And this feeling of freedom
creates a sense of dread.

145
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,506
A dizzy feeling.

146
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,093
Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

147
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,095
RITA: The students love you,

148
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:35,266
but, of course, you've raised
some eyebrows with the faculty.

149
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,187
- Do you ever get discouraged teaching?
- No.

150
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,272
You don't ever ask yourself
what the hell is it all about?

151
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:42,440
Mmm-mmm.

152
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,027
Another school, another batch of kids.

153
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,196
Sweet kids.

154
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,448
Mmm. Average kids.

155
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,034
Nice, but mostly mediocre.

156
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:56,454
They'll grow up to be those people
who shape the world with their ignorance

157
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,040
or misinformation, or passivity.

158
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,794
- Are you okay?
- Hmm?

159
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,755
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,549
You want to come in?
This is where I live.

161
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:12,220
Paul's in Aspen at a symposium.
I've got great grass.

162
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,890
- (CLICKS TONGUE) Some other time.
- Are you sure?

163
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,309
Yeah.

164
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,062
Thanks. Thanks anyway.
I'll see you.

165
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:28,152
Tomorrow we're gonna discuss
phenomenology and Husserl.

166
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,279
So, be sure you do the reading, you know?

167
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,281
It can get a little complicated.

168
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,491
All right?

169
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,422
Hi, you wanted to see me?

170
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,008
Yes, your paper was quite good.

171
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,178
- Really?
- Yes.

172
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,514
I read so many papers and,

173
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,016
usually the students are merely
paraphrasing what they've read,

174
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,520
but I found your thinking
fresh and well-presented.

175
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,440
Oh, thank you.
I'm flattered.

176
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:12,530
I have to say, I was very influenced by
your ideas on randomness and chance.

177
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,325
Well, the truth is,
what I found most exciting

178
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,661
was when you took issue with my ideas.

179
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,705
When you disagreed with me,

180
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,542
your arguments were
well-reasoned and original.

181
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,713
(LAUGHING) Am I blushing right now?

182
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:32,216
That's a really big compliment.
Thank you.

183
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:37,513
Um, I did actually find
some parts of your book

184
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,724
a little hard to follow though,

185
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,061
and I would love if you
could explain some things to me.

186
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:48,524
Sure, can we get out of here,
though, before I die of suffocation?

187
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,987
I found your view of existence
too bleak for me.

188
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:57,199
It was like there were
no redeeming joys or pleasures.

189
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,409
Okay.

190
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:02,371
Why are you taking philosophy?
What do you want out of it?

191
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,040
Because if your goal is
to try and figure out

192
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,168
what all this bullshit's about, forget it.

193
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:10,838
You write books, you write papers.
You've done so much.

194
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:14,884
Well, let me tell you, when I look back
at all that verbal posturing,

195
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,470
my group thought we were
going to be so special.

196
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,931
I marched in every bullshit
political demonstration.

197
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,601
I spent six months in Darfur
getting food to starving families,

198
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,311
I wind up with meningitis.

199
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,563
- Mmm.
- I was in Bangladesh.

200
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,250
Yeah, you know, you want to see
a difference, to save the world.

201
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:33,861
(SIGHING) But when you see
what you're up against...

202
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:37,323
Do you like vintage single malt?
You drink?

203
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,076
You mean here?

204
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,287
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLING) Right now?

205
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,915
(CHUCKLING) No, no, I couldn't.

206
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:50,753
JILL: <i>There was no way I could have
realized from that first conversation</i>

207
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,506
<i>that a lot was very wrong with Abe.</i>

208
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:58,094
<i>He was so damn fascinating and vulnerable,
and I must say, I found him attractive.</i>

209
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,429
<i>I guess it helped that
he felt comfortable with me.</i>

210
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,139
I drove a cab.

211
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:05,101
- I was a handyman in a building.
- (CHUCKLES)

212
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,895
I ran an elevator.
But I always read.

213
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,357
Always, always loved the Russian writers.

214
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,776
Especially Dostoyevsky.
Dostoyevsky got it.

215
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,946
I've read all of it.

216
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,948
- Really?
- Mmm.

217
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,243
JILL: Oh, I had a great conversation
with Abe Lucas the other day.

218
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,452
Uh-huh.

219
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,746
He said my paper was
well-organized and original.

220
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,956
- All right.
- Right?

221
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,416
Yeah, I can see where this is goin'.

222
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,543
Oh, stop it, please.

223
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,712
He's just fascinating because he's brilliant,
but he's a sufferer.

224
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,006
Perfect. Great, you always
became attracted to the sufferers.

225
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,675
Right? That's how we first met.

226
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,718
He's a real sufferer, Roy.
You had shingles.

227
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,970
(CHUCKLES)

228
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:44,306
He was traumatized
when his best friend was killed in Iraq.

229
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,102
- He was a journalist, just horrifying.
- Didn't he get his head cut off?

230
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,729
His head cut off?
No, no, it was an explosion.

231
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,939
ROY: Oh.

232
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:55,693
God, it's amazing how people
embellish these stories.

233
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,571
You know, Abe actually says
that people just manufacture drama

234
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,449
so they can get through their lives
because they're so empty.

235
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,410
Can we just change the subject
of Abe Lucas, please?

236
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,996
You've been, like, singing
his praises for half an hour.

237
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,039
All right, well, then,
how about I sing yours?

238
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,750
- Okay. Yeah, yeah. Good.
- How's that?

239
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,252
I love you in that sweater.

240
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,588
Of course, you love me in this sweater.
You bought it for me.

241
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,716
Well, you look great in that shade of blue.

242
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,509
You really do.

243
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,429
You know Abe's mother committed suicide?

244
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:24,680
Abe again?

245
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,183
I mean, can you imagine?
He was 12.

246
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,019
She drank bleach!
It's so sad.

247
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,356
You know, Simone de Beauvoir pointed out,
and quite correctly,

248
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,775
that in a society shaped by men,

249
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,112
women are seen as relative beings
existing only in relationship to men.

250
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,406
- Hmm.
- You agree with that?

251
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,701
- I agree with that completely.
- Mmm-hmm.

252
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,787
I'm sure you've heard the rumors about you.

253
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,124
That you've had a lot of
experience with women.

254
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,210
You mean slept with.

255
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,004
You find that fulfilling?

256
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,590
Many women and one-night stands?

257
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,051
I did at the time.

258
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,095
It had a certain frantic quality.

259
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,140
One day, it stopped being exciting.

260
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,518
I couldn't find distraction anymore

261
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,938
in that usually reliable painkiller,
the orgasm.

262
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,023
Why not?

263
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,610
I couldn't remember the reason for living.

264
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,155
(SIGHING) And when I did,
it wasn't convincing.

265
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,366
That sounds scary.

266
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,662
It's very scary when
you run out of distractions.

267
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,248
Well, what if it wasn't a distraction?

268
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:36,252
What if you just decided
to commit yourself to one person?

269
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,714
If I met someone now,
I'm too far gone to appreciate her.

270
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,262
(SIGHING) I have to go to my piano lesson.

271
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,057
What are you doing on Friday night?

272
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,478
(SIGHING) Oh, I don't know.
Why?

273
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,147
I think you should come to a party.

274
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,816
- Uh...
- I do.

275
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,652
Roy and I will take you.
We can go and it'll...

276
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,571
There'll be music and it'll be fun.

277
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,114
There's a lot of students that like you.

278
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:07,491
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
- There really are.

279
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,898
And I think it's better than
just wallowing in your room.

280
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,371
I don't think that's healthy.

281
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,416
You should think about it.
You want to come out?

282
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,460

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

284
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,649
- Yes?
- Hi.

285
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,321
I'm sorry for dropping in so suddenly but,

286
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:49,450
I was shopping today at
the liquor store, and,

287
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:53,621
I came across these two very fine bottles
of single malt scotch,

288
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,247
and I got one for Paul and myself.

289
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,125
And I know how much
you love single malt scotch.

290
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,212
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.
How much do I owe you?

291
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,382
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, God, no, I bought it for you.

292
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,551
Oh, thank you.

293
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,306
You could have waited to give it to me.
You didn't have to come in the rain.

294
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,225
I couldn't wait.
I was excited over it.

295
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,854
Will you have one with me?

296
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,148
I thought you'd never ask.

297
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,944
Um... Hmm.

298
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,781
What have you been doing?

299
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:33,243
I'm trying to finish this book
I started a long time ago.

300
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,580
- What's it about?
- About Heidegger and fascism.

301
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,458
Just what the world needs.

302
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:44,129
Another book about Heidegger and fascism.

303
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,091
How's it coming?

304
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:51,637
I'm blocked.
I can't write.

305
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,056

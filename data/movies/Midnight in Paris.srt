1
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,350
This is unbelievable!
Look at this!

2
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,410
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!

3
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,740
You act like you've never been here before.

4
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,600
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.

5
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,890
Can you picture how drop-dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain?

6
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,220
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s,

7
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,535
in the rain; the artists and writers.

8
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,730
Why does every city have to be in the rain?

9
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,115
What's wonderful about getting wet?

10
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,810
I mean, could you ever picture us
moving here after we're married?

11
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,470
Oh God, no.

12
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,710
I could never live out of the United States.

13
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,445
You know, if I'd stayed here
and written novels,

14
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,970
and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,
just, grinding out movie scripts...

15
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,715
I'll tell you something:

16
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,120
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,

17
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:30,100
the pool, everything,
in a second.

18
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,610
I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.

19
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:34,610
We're 30 minutes from town.

20
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,575
Imagine the two of us settling here.

21
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,140
We could do it, I mean,
if my book turns out.

22
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,730
You're in love with a fantasy.

23
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,420
I'm in love with you.

24
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,370
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.

25
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,610
Let's meet 'em.

26
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,640
<i>There are our sightseers.</i>

27
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,240
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again, I...

28
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,232
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.

29
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:09,155
I could see myself living here!

30
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,175
I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me. "

31
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,410
I can see myself just strolling
along the Left Bank with a,

32
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,315
you know, baguette under my arm,

33
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,020
headed to CafÃƒÂ© de Flore
to scribble away on my book.

34
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,830
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a "moveable feast. "

35
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,610
In this traffic, nothing moves.

36
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
Well, a toast to John's
new business venture here!

37
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,890
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

38
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,180
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,495
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.

40
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,320
I'm excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the French company, but otherwise,

41
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,990
I'm not a big Francophile.

42
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,040
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.

43
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,955
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them

44
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,880
for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.

45
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,005
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this

46
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,080
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into... By the way, it's

47
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,150
fine for your father and I to disagree.

48
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,325
That's what a democracy is.

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,090
Your father defends the right-wing
of the Republican party,

50
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,210
and I happen to think you almost got to be

51
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,530
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!

52
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,320
But it doesn't mean we don't
respect each other's views, am I right?

53
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,840
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.

54
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,950
Let's do that.

55
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,520
- Your father is just...
- Inez?

56
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,270
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.

57
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,670
Oh my G... What are you doing here?

58
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,730
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,890
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

60
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,100
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother

61
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,650
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.

62
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,340
Well, you... you didn't mention
you were going to be here.

63
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,540
No, it was sudden. Um...

64
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,600
Paul got invited to lecture at
the Sorbone. Sorbonne.

65
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,270
Oh, how wonderful!

66
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,520
Well, uh, Dad's here on business,
and we just decided to

67
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,280
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.

68
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,310
That's great.
We can spend some time together.

69
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,990
Well, I think we have a
lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...

70
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,965
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,910
- We're driving to Verrsailles.
- Versailles...

72
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,990
- Versailles.
- Oh,

73
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,955
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!

74
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,690
But it's too... uh...
We're late... I think what we're...

75
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,800
Tomorrow we're locked in
to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.

76
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,700
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...

77
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,460
You know I actually had
a professor that dined there,

78
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,440
and saw James Joyce!

79
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,505
Yeah, you know, like a
million years ago, and

80
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,240
apparently, Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters.

81
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,580
Is that...
That's the end of the story?

82
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,610
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...

83
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:42,630
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.

84
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,450
I hope you're not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.

85
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:47,880
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!

86
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,015
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.

87
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, I mean, they're your
friends, and I have to admit

88
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.

89
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,340
He's brilliant.

90
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,900
You know, I had such a crush on him
in college, and Carol's very bright.

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,140
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.

92
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,895
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,

93
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,900
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at
the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.

94
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,510
You should give him your book to read.

95
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:15,055
Oh, come on. Why?

96
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,115
No, because he could critique your writing,

97
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,580
and maybe show you why you're
having so much trouble.

98
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,580
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack

99
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,460
who never gave actual
literature a real shot.

100
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,825
- Until now.
- Please... Gil...

101
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,160
Honey, just promise me something.

102
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,880
If this book... doesn't pan out,

103
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,535
that you'll stop
eating your brains out,

104
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,130
and just go back to doing
what you do best.

105
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,950
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,480
Do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle?

107
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,570
- Well...
- Mmm?

108
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,420
Mmm?

109
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,130
Why would you... want to do that?

110
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,470
I believe Louis moved his court here,

111
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,810
uh, in 1682.

112
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,900
Originally, all this was swampland.

113
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,780
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,

114
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,110
uh... in Old French, the word "versailles"

115
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,400
means, uh, something like,

116
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,770
- "terrain were the weeds have been pulled. "
- Is that right?

117
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,480
Uh... The... uh, middle section here

118
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,335
uh... is... uh,
French classical style at its height.

119
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,500
Uh... The work, I believe, of...
uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)

120
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,325
- Yes.
- Uh... Mansart... I think...

121
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,660
- Manzard.
- ... and Charles le Brun, I believe.

122
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,670
Yes, that's right.

123
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,790
I could get used to a summer home like this.

124
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,852
- I know you could.
- Me, too,

125
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:36,845
except, remember: in those days,

126
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,935
they only had baths,
and I'm definitely a shower man.

127
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,760
Where are you two planning on
moving after you get married?

128
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,025
Uh... Malibu.

129
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,695
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.

130
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm pushing for a little
attic in Paris with a skylight.

131
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:50,555
- La bowhem?
- Yeah,

132
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,310
all that's missing is the tuberculosis.

133
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,890
Exactly. Thank you.

134
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,780
I mean, you know, the problem
is that he's not exactly sure

135
00:09:56,815 --> 00:09:58,745
- he can write a novel.
- Really?

136
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,480
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's... you know, and...

137
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,870
well, everyone loves your movies.

138
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,440
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.

139
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,120
Why don't you tell them about the lead
character that you're working on right now?

140
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,955
- Yes! - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.

141
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,690
Well, dear, you don't have to tell
them the whole plot, just the character.

142
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,645
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

143
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,385
He works in a nostalgia shop.

144
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,790
- What's a... What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell

145
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:25,365
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?

146
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,370
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.

147
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,730
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past,

148
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,590
people who think that
their lives would be happier

149
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,980
if they lived in an earlier time.

150
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,645
And just which era

151
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,990
would you have preferred
to live in, Miniver Cheevy?

152
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,090
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.

153
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,960
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.

154
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,970
Oh, I see! And no global warming,

155
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,015
no TV and suicide bombing,

156
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,455
and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!

157
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,860
Usual menu of clichÃƒÂ©d horror stories.

158
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,980
You know, nostalgia is denial.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,370
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!

160
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,180
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be

161
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,270
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial.

162
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:08,470
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy

163
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:11,840
is called "golden-age thinking. "

164
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,505
- TouchÃƒÂ©.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that

165
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,180
a different time period is better
than the one one's living in.

166
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:21,820
It's a flaw in the Romantic
imagination of those people who...

167
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,030
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive.

168
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,330
<i>- Yes.
- This is the nicest ring we saw.</i>

169
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:31,840
Diamonds for a wedding band.

170
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,430
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see

171
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,000
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger.

172
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,050
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!

173
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,260
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.

174
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,380
It's your choice. What can I say?

175
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,030
Gil is... he's smart,
and he's very successful.

176
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,890
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.

177
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,400
Well, that frightens me.

178
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,050
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.

179
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,445
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.

180
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,945
Rodin wished it to serve as his
headstone and epitaph.

181
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,310
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,

182
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:17,625
if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.

183
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,420
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?

184
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work
was influenced by his wife, Camille.

185
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,710
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.

186
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,950
- Camille? No.
- Yes.

187
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,970
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.

188
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,795
Yes, he did marry Rose,

189
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,390
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.

190
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,625
Are you arguing with the guide?

191
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,820
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.

192
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,105
Yeah, actually, she's right.

193
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,770
I recently read a two-volume
biography on Rodin, and

194
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,620
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.

195
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,320
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it. I was surprised

196
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:00,270
because I mistakenly thought,
like you, that it was, yeah,

197
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,685
the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.

198
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,875
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.

199
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,030
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:09,615
Paul is an expert on French wine.

201
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,350
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.

202
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,810
When did you read the biography on Rodin?

203
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,070
Me? Why would I read
a biography on Rodin?

204
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,410
I will always take a California wine, but,

205
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,080
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.

206
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,445
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?

207
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,740
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?

208
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,310
Come on. I can't stand that guy.

209
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,635
Um... How 'bout

210
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,310
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.

211
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,875
Now, which would you prefer here?

212
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,400
Well, I think we need
to be scientific and just

213
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,855
start drinking them all again. I don't know.

214
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,470
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?

215
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,095
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.

216
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,440
Oh, maybe it's because of the
pheromones that you're giving off.

217
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:58,365
These pheromones are driving me mad!

218
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,500
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh... Sex and alcohol.

219
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,235
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire

220
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,270
but kills the performance,
according to the Bard.

221
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,930
Have you tasted the '61?

222
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,445
It is divine!

223
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,290
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?

224
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,890
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59,

225
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,190
and I prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling.

226
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,040
So, Carol... Carol and I
are gonna go dancing.

227
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,310
We heard of a great place. Interested?

228
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,850
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on!

229
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:33,980
but I need to get a little fresh air.

230
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh, come on! Come on!

231
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,040
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess

232
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,975
over where the fire exits are, then...

233
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,010
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.

234
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,195
I am very democratic,

235
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,235
and Paul is a marvelous dancer.

236
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,350
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk,

237
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:54,187
go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.

238
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:56,990
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?

239
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,320
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,

240
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,110
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,
and I've been dying to go dancing,

241
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,150
and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.

242
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,520
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.

243
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,205
I'll get a cab. Taxi!

244
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,330
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab. I'm walking.

245
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:15,400
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.

246
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,990
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?

247
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:24,970
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,690
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him.

249
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:31,930
- That would be great!
- Would you?

250
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,940
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?

251
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,820
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!

252
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,395
And you wouldn't pull any punches?

253
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,290
- Well, I certainly won't be letting you know I won't do that.
- No.

254
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,510
I do that about you.

255
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,535
See, but, the problem is,
when it comes to his writing,

256
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,980
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else's opinion.

257
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,330
Really?

258
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,550
<i>Oh, excuse me! Parlez-vous...
Do you speak English?</i>

259
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,820
<i>- Uh... HÃƒÂ´tel Bristol?
- We don't speak English. Sorry.</i>

<i>Hey! Get in! Come on!</i>

261
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,020
<i>Get in! We're going to leave you!</i>

262
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:34,390
- What?
- Come on, guy.

263
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,690
- I didn't hear you. What?
- Come on!

264
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,770
Come on, guy!
Get in the car!

265
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,350
Guys, I think you've got me mixed up.

266
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,575
<i>You're making me tired. Come on!</i>

267
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,660
I can't understand you.
I'm a little drunk! I can't...

268
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,500
What is this, an old Peugeot?
I have a friend who collects these in Beverly Hills.

269
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:56,900
Come on, have a drink. Come on!

270
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,820
- Come on, buddy! Come on!
- OK.

271
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,350
<i>Give me your hand. OK.
Sit down, here.</i>

272
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,760
<i>- Let's go in. Paris, the city of lights.
- Let's go! We're off!</i>

273
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,420
OK, now, where are
you guys taking me?

274
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,400
<i>We're going to party!</i>

275
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,790
Yeah, this isn't quite fair,
'cause I've already had a lot of red wine tonight.

276
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,960
<i>Relax! Have some champagne.</i>

277
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:28,100
I do like champagne, yeah...

278
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,330
<i>Cheers! Cheers!
- The night is young. Drink up!</i>

279
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:34,850
- I'm drinking!
- Have a drink!

280
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:37,070
Yeah, drink up!

300
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,200
- Yes, what it is, sweetheart?
- Here's a writer, from, um... where?

301
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,340
- California.
- Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you, old sport?

302
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:38,610
Gil... the...
You have the same names as...

303
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,315
As what?

304
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,615
Scott Fitzgerald and...

305
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,400
Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds.
Isn't she beautiful?

306
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:54,150
Yes. Yes! Yeah, that's...
that's a coincidence... like... uh...

307
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:01,460
You have a glazed look in your eye.
Stunned. Stupefied. Anesthetized. Lobotomized.

308
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,775
I... I... keep looking at the man playing piano, and I

309
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,240
believe it or not, recognize his
face from some old sheet music.

310
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,300
I know I can be one of the great writers
of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,

311
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:22,240
and then I hear the songs he writes,
and then I realize: I'll never write a great lyric,

312
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:25,970
- and my talent really lies in drinking.
- Sure does.

313
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:30,700
Yeah, but, he didn't write the music, did he?

314
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:33,900
That's not possible...

315
00:21:33,935 --> 00:21:35,725
So... um...

316
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,670
- What kind of books do you write?
- I... I... I'm working on a... um...

317
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:44,635
Where am I?

318
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,595
Oh, I'm sorry. Don't you know the host?

319
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,780
Some friends have gotten together
a little party for Jean Cocteau.

320
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,880
Hey, lady. What...
Are you kiddding me?

321
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,740
I know what you're thinking.
This is boring. I agree!

322
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:05,770
I'm ready to move on. Let's do Bricktop's!

323
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,770
- Bricktop's?
- I'm bored! He's bored! We're all bored.

324
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:11,815
We. Are. All. Bored.
Let's do Bricktop's.

325
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,480
Why don't you tell Cole and Linda
to come with, and... um...

326
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,675
uh... Gil? You coming?

327
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,130

This is one of the finest establishments
in Paris. They do a diamond whiskey sour.

<i>Good evening, everyone!</i>

<i>A small shot of bourbon, please.</i>

336

Greetings and salutations.

337
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,560
You'll forgive me.
I've been mixing grain and grape.

338
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,290
Now, this a writer. uh... Gil. Yes?

339
00:24:05,325 --> 00:24:07,800
- Gil... Gil Pender.
- Gil Pender.

340
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,780
Hemingway.

341
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,295
Hemingway?

342
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,215
You liked my book?

343
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,130
Liked? I loved!
All your work.

344
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,040
Yes, it was a good book,
because it was an honest book,

345
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,465
and that's what war does to men.

346
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,760
And there's nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud,

347
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,895
unless you die gracefully,

348
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,790
and then it's not only noble, but brave.

349
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:35,615
Did you read my story?
What'd you think?

350
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,445
There was some fine writing in it,
but it was unfulfilled.

351
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,790
- I might've known you'd hate it.
- But darling, you're too sensitive.

352
00:24:42,825 --> 00:24:44,755
You liked my story, but he hates me!

353
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,655
Please, old sport,
you make matters extremely difficult.

354
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,680
I'm jumpy. Suddenly I don't like
the atmosphere here any more.

355
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:54,365
Ah! Where're you going?

356
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,145
<i>To meet some friends on Saint-Germain.</i>

357
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,445
- He's going to Saint-Germain. I'm going with him.
- Zelda, sweetheart...

358
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,710
If you're going to stay here and drink
with him, I'm going with the toreador.

359
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,070
Would you bring her back
at a reasonable time?

360
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,860
- She'll drive you crazy, this woman.
- She's exciting,

361
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,665
and she has talent.

362
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,415
This month it's writing.
Last month it was something else.

363
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,790
You're a writer. You need time to write.
Not all this fooling around.

364
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:22,130
She's wasting you because she's
really a competitor. Don't you agree?

365
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:22,695
Me?

366
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,140
Speak up, for Christ's sake! I'm asking if
you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.

367
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,995
Actually, I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well.

368
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,880
You're a writer. You make observations.
You were with them all night!

369
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:34,755
Could we not discuss my personal life in public?

370
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,680
She's jealous of his gift,
and it's a fine gift. It's rare.

371
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,850
- You like his work? You can speak for it.
- Stop it! Stop it.

372
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:44,547
You like Mark Twain?

373
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:46,175
I'm going to find Zelda.

374
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,220
I don't like the thought
of her with that Spaniard.

375
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,415
May I?

376
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,855
Yeah, I'm actually a huge Mark Twain fan.

377
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,660
I think you can even make the case
that all modern American literature

378
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:01,195
comes from Huckleberry Finn.

379
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,590
- You box?
- No. Not really. No.

380
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,165
What're you writing?

381
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,525
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?

382
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,080
It's about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop.

383
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:18,080
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?

384
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,110
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.

385
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:24,320
and... Does that sound terrible?

386
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,085
No subject is terrible if the story is true.

387
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,640
If the prose is clean and honest,
and if it affirms grace and co

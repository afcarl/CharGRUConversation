00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,380
I'm already 16 years old...

3
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,020
but I already know how
my life'll look like...

4
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,560
Yesterday, today...

5
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,960
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow...

6
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,930
Every day, without many changes...

7
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,799
Hey Tanaka!

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,310
What's with this melon bread you bought?

9
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:53,960
Eh?

10
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:56,259
Don't say 'eh'!!!

11
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,559
The surface is spoilt all over!

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,210
This is not how the melon bread should be!

13
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:01,830
OUCH!

14
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,499
Somehow...

15
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,640
even if I exist or not...

16
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,720
the world is still moving forward.

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,539
Hey, koyuki!

18
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,160
How long are you going to let
the Hyoudo band bother you?

19
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,759
Hey!

20
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,439
He's Yukio Tanaka, right?

21
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,039
Why call him Koyuki?

22
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,599
Earlier, there were two
Yukio Tanakas in class.

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,519
The smaller one was given the name Koyuki.

24
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,909
It's right.

25
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,080
I'm a boring guy.

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,080
I was wondering if I'll always
lead this kind of boring life...

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,240
Until I met this one guy...

28
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,719
He looks so scared.

29
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,759
Shaking like a leaf, Man.

30
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,279
You don't hold on tight.

31
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,660
Come on, let's see you jump it.

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,439
He ain't taking the risk.

33
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,279
You want us help you jump, huh?

34
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,359
Just f**king jump, Man.

35
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
He's f**king ugly!

36
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,640
Do you want us to push you over?
You little freak of nature!

37
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,759
What's that?

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,020
Are you some kind of hero?

39
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,680
What are you doing, man?... - Sorry, sorry.

40
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,600
Hey!

41
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,880
Mother fucker man!

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,560
Skinny bastard!

43
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:28,880
Beck!

44
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,039
You think you can get away with
anything, you fucking white trash?

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Fuck you!

46
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,800
Apologise to him!

47
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,160
I SAID...

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,880
APOLOGISE, Goddamnit!

49
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,160
Are you fine?

50
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,759
It hurts, it hurts!

51
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,580
I got carried away..

52
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,639
This one is Beck!

53
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,520
He is my friend!

54
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm Minami Ryusuke.

55
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,519
I'm Yukio Tanaka.

56
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
All the people call me Koyuki.

57
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,480
Ah, shit!

58
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,680
Wha... Wait!

Didn't you hear what I said?

61
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,840
Hey Yuji!

62
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,760
Why do we have to die our
hair for the same colour?

63
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,599
That's our band policy.

64
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,500
Our music is not going to get
better with the hair color.

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,539
Calm down, calm down!

66
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,260
Calm down, calm down.

67
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,319
That guy's there!

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,160
He's got decent technique.

69
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,999
It seems that

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,760
guys from the recording company came!

71
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,780
Hey! This guitar! It has holes!

72
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,260
Wha...?

73
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,480
They won't do.

74
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:28,280
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

75
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,480
It was a failure!

76
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,640
Us working together.

77
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,319
Ryusuke...

78
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,240
I will create the best band ever!

79
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,820
I will create one too.

80
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,400
Eiji.

81
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,839
This is your punishment!

82
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,199
I'll throw you into the darkest pitch!!

83
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,840
Sorry!

84
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,599
It's your fault!

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,979
They found out my meals,
my habit even my address!

86
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,999
Then...

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
I'll pay you back.

88
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,679
Since when do you have that much?

89
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,339
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,879
Can't do!

91
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,919
I said calm down!

92
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,119
I'll introduce you to girls!

93
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,239
There are lots to choose from.

94
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
Really?

95
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,200
I promise man!

96
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,720
I want a hottie!

97
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,099
Erm...

98
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,840
Beck?

99
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,759
You...

100
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,469
This... what time is... this this one...

101
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,600
What time is your... you know.

102
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,799
Closing time?

103
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,659
Yes, this one!

104
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,960
Japanese language is haaaard!

105
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,680
Obasan, I'm home.

106
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Oh, Beck, welcome home.

107
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,280
I'm living and working here.

108
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
I see.

109
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,320
You have lots of CDs here.

110
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,399
Ryusuke-kun.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,099
Did Beck run away again?

112
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,599
Yes.

113
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,900
A regular customer of the
fishing pond - mr. Satou.

114
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:54,680
Hello.

115
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,479
Greatful Sound.

116
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,179
A festival gathering for all the best bands.

117
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,959
Right, Ryuusuke-kun?

118
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,199
Here, 300 yen.

119
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,520
Good night!
Good Night!

120
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,080
This song... you played it today?

121
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,400
We covered Dying Breed's "Flatliner".

122
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,440
The guy holding a guitar is Dying
Breed's Eddy, my close friend.

123
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,150
Really?

127
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,540
That guitar...

128
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,809
Get the F**K out of here.

129
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,660
Come on Man! I need to see him.

130
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,729
Dying Breed just got a major record deal.

131
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,350
And I can deal with the F***ing top flights,
you know that?

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,129
Wait!

133
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,990
Please I gotta leave New York tomorrow.

134
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,510
Hey!... Eddy... Hey, man!

135
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,179
Listen, bro.

136
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,329
You're gonna keep playin' in Japan, right?

138
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:52,200
I know music is gonna keep us together.

139
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,950
Listen, we gotta jam together
again some time, ok?

140
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:01,950
Doesn't matter if it's a huge festival...
or some tiny fckn club.

141
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,819
Listen... Take this, okay?

142
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,810

Hey, Eddy!

147
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,369
I'll ______ this

148
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,660

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,669
Aaaaaargh! For God's sake!

150
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,450
Can't you just shut up?!&gt;

151
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,190
I'm trying to read a manga.

152
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,319
Damn it, Maho, I told you
not to come with that act.

Hey! Hey!

My little sis, Maho.

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,399
My parents aren't home,
so she's staying here.

156
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,149
Oh!

157
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,459
Oh Yea!

158
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,850
I have to give you
something for saving Beck.

159
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,970
Are you talking about reward?

160
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,889
Oh, don't bother.

161
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,729
C'mon tell me.

162
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,730
Is there anything I can do for you.

163
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,610
Then...

164
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,250
teach me how to play a guitar.

165
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,489
I'll give you this guitar.

166

buy him a Melon bread.

170
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,820
We told him!

171
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,969
Sensei... Sensei.

172
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,990
Sensei... Sensei!

173
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,870
It's locked.

174
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,499
You! Stop it right now! Hey!

175
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,129
What are you doing!?!!

176
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,940
Stop it, you brat!

177
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,130
It's Dying Breed's "Flatliner".

178
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,750
You chose a cool song.

179
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,290
Who are you?

180
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:02,010
I'm in Class 1 B... Sakurai Yuji...
I just transferred today.

181
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,690
Sakurai-kun!

182
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,449
It's better if you don't talk to me a lot.

183
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,050
Why?

184
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,769
That guy... is playing guitar at the roof.

185
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,929
That Koyuki is so cocky!

186
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,930
Hey!

187
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,610
So you guys are Hyouda group.

188
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,229
The guys who make school unbearable, huh?

189
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,850
Who the hell are you?

190
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,780
Sakurai-Kun!

191
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,569
I thought I'll give this to you.

192
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,050
Dying breed's live from Germany.

193
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,530
The stairs are barricaded.

194
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:57,530
The first one was for five days.

195
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,050
Yo!

196
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,690
Can you go drinking today?

197
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,419
So that... erm...

198
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,469
But... we can split the cost...

199
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,010
During the time we didn't see each
other, your Japanese improved greatly.

200
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,049
Well...

201
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,810
It might be sudden, but...

202
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,719
Taira-Kun.

203
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,910
Would you like to be in a band with me?

204
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,479
Ryusuke...

205
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,220
To be honest, Eiji asked me too.

206
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,970
Eh?

207
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,929
The earlier jam with him, you know...

208
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,560
he's improved so much so quickly.

209
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,810
If you want me to play with you...
come when you find an amazing voice.

210
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,890
Let's eat yakiniku (fried meat).

211
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,249
<i>Hey, hey, do you know him?</i>

212
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,130
<i>I ain't gonna tell ya...
You'll know when ya hear him.</i>

213
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,589
<i>Who asked you? You're just a nobody.</i>

214
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:10,290
<i>You should never get the mic...
Let me tell ya, you gonna get dumped.</i>

215
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

216
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:19,410
If you're for the MC. Make some noise!

217
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,069
If you're for Chiba. Make some noise!

218
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,690
Chiba!

219
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,010
That's for sure, CHIBA!

220
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,250
DJ Harry, drop it!

221
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,970
<i>Yeah, come on let's do it.</i>

222
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,009
Yeah..

223
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,810
Let's go!

224
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,689
<i>Hurry and just finish
it to the final.</i>

225
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,089
<i>Your rapping is just plain boring.</i>

226
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:49,250
<i>Shut up and stop your barking...
You'll soon go crying.</i>

227
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,809
<i>Just get it over, I want no more.</i>

228
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,529
<i>I feel sorry for this guy here.</i>

229
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,929
<i>The music, listen to the music...
Or are you deaf and can't hear it?</i>

230
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,249
<i>You've been babbling gibberish..</i>

231
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,569
<i>All this time nothing but gibberish.</i>

232
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,929
<i>You've got no fans, no brothers...
Just go home!</i>

233
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,329
<i>Hey, we've started so
I hafta finish it.</i>

234
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,489
<i>There's still time if
you wanna quit now.</i>

235
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,640
<i>I'll make you regret it all...
I'm gonna beat ya in this show case.</i>

236
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,529
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Look, look...

237
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,370
If you're for Chiba, make some noise!

238
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,530
People for Oz, give him a shout!

239
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,970
The victory goes to Chiba!

240
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,250
Oi, what's wrong, Chiba?

241
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,130
It's not here...

242
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,570
Chiba!

243
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,530
After all, there's only
Taira's bass for our band!

244
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,989
<i>Just tell me the truth.</i>

245
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,730
<i>Is it all about money?...
Aah, that hurts, Man..</i>

246
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:28,650
<i>Or maybe it's your lucky day.</i>

247
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:32,509
<i>I don't care whichever way.</i>

248
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,620
<i>You can just do it your way.</i>

249
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:56,289
I've still got some business to deal with,
so you two can leave first.

250
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,609
What?!

251
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,909
<i>I thought you're going to take
me out to yakiniku!</i>

252
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,950
Get Koyuki to treat you.

253
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,090
Eh?

254
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,840
<i>Hello... Yakiniku?</i>

255
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,110
Hey, Yoshito... What's up!

256
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,620
Right now?

257
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,869
Hey, the girls are really coming?

258
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,779
Wait just a little bit.

259
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,849
The hotties will be here.

260
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,399
Lots to choose from...

261
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,290
Here he comes.

262
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,820
The bassist from earlier...?

263
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,719
Ryusuke, is this that Chiba guy?

264
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,270
Can he really sing?

265
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,269
The other day I met a guy.

266
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,839
He tried to pick me up...
But he's such an asshole, right.

267
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,469
But he drives a BM convertible.

268
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,749
Really? Oh my god, I love that car.

269
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,790
I know, me too...

270
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:06,899
But you know, he's gross...
Like he twitches his eye when he talks..

271
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,729
Which is so disgusting.

272
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,659
So lame... But there are guys like
that at American schools too, right.

273
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,399
Hey, Guys...

274
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,409
Yoshito!... Hey Maho.

275
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,939
Hey Saori.

276
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,880
You finished shooting?

277
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,699
Hey!

278
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,629
That means toilet, right!

279
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,029
I guess so.

280
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,780
Oh yea, ...
You're not so good with Kanji, right!

281
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,130
Shut the F**K up!... Mind your own business.

282
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,730
Who are you?

283
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,840
What the heck?

284
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,049
What's wrong?

285
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,919
I'm not going home today.

286
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,470
I'll go to Ryusuke's place.

287
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,339
I'm sorry about earlier.

288
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,289
It's ok... It's true that
I'm not good at Japanese.

289
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:32,720
That's the reason why yesterday...
I got fired from my part time job.

290
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,200
Your Japanese is good enough.

291
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,030
Just Kidding.

292
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,910
I see how it is.

293
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,010
Ryusuke, what's the song?... Evolution.

294
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,279
<i>Let me borrow this mic to tell ya...
There are things out there you've gotta respect.</i>

295
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,789
<i>Now we're here, just try to grab it.</i>

296
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,620
<i>Whatever goal you're aiming for.</i>

297
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,590
<i>Yeah..</i>

298
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,700
<i>Y'all..</i>

299
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,210
<i>Nice to see y'all here, folks..</i>

300
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,569
Hey,

301
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,140
How do you say full moon in Japanese?

302
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,689
"Mangetsu"

303
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,680
Ah, that's it.

304
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,450
"Mangetsu"

305
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:27,570
<i>I'm walking down this believe
in the hope to find the sun.</i>

306
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:38,900
<i>And I'm guided by the wind
that blows against my face.</i>

307
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,590
<i>Well, you know I...</i>

308
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,089
"Naked" wasn't it?

309
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,009
Dying Breed's song, right?!

310
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,620
I like it very much so I remembered it.

311
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,190
Was my pronunciation okay?

312
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,050
That guitar...

313
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,700
Let us borrow it for a lil bit.

314
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,219
Did you just...

315
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,230
laugh at me?

316
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,049
Don't play dumb!... You just laughed at me!

317
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,750
I did not.

318
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,610
Saku...

319
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,349
"Ryusuke's Snake Pit"... - Nope!

320
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,549
Minami Ryusuke and Family..

321
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,939
Why's all got your name?!... So lame!!

322
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,980
Shut up... Why don't you
come up with a name then?

323
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,650
Is Beck ok?

324
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,380
But that's a dog.

325
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,729
Now..now..

326
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,409
Lets just use it as a temporary until
we come up with a cooler name.

327
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,830
Okay.

328
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,790
Who are you?

329
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,209
Ah..

330
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,140
Oh, you came!

331
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,650
What's this?

332
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,429
I'm sorry.

333
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,069
It's my fault that this happened.

334
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,679
I'm sorry.

335
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,370
Get the F**K out of here.

336
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,410
Koyuki...

337
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,189
What's wrong?

338
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,330
Yelling out loud.

339
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,170
Yo!

340
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,680
Did you go to Ryusuke's place?

341
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,850
This can be fixed.

342
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,429
What?

343
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,069
Give it two months, I can have it fixed.

344
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,410
Are you sure?

345
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,780
Why don't I pay for the repair?

346
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,830
Really?

347
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,310
However...

348
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,360
You're a big help!

349
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:40,349
The Sri Lankan guy who worked here before just quit...
I didn't know what to do.

350
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,790
Doing slave work like this...
no wonder he ran away!

351
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,689
Hey, don't slack!...
Hurry up and finish the job!

352
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,650
We've got a deadline at six o'clock!

353
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,489
The pay is only 500 yen an hour..

354
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,969
This is slavery!

355
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,109
Stop complaining!

356
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,300
Just get the job done!

357
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,610
And then...

358
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,879
Wrong!
How many times do I need to tell you?

359
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,529
Pick on the notes one by one.

360
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,109
Do it again!

361
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,050
Okay.

362
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,370
But why are you wearing swimming gear?

363
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,539
It's hard to tell now, ...
but I was an pre-olympic swimmer when I was young.

364
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,639
Wow, you looked totally different!

365
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,249
When I failed the Olympics selection, ...
I was so depressed... But you know my consolation...?

366
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,790
These guitars!

367
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,289
Amazing!

368
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,609
Now, do it from the beginning!

369
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,789
Okay.

370
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,510
1..2..

371
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,809
Chiba and Taira and Toma and Ryu...
We're BECK.

372
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,030
Evolution!!

373
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,610
Hey!

374
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,410
Koyuki!

375
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,950
Koyuki...

376
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,790
Koyuki.

377
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,150
Hey!

378
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,289
Ryusuke-kun, ... I'm sorry but
working with you isn't fun anymore.

379
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,569
You just don't fit in my scale..

380
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,589
Hey Toma-kun!

381
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,550
Let him go.

382
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,370
Why are you so hasty?

383
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,130
Why did you come here?

384
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,670
I've got the guitar fixed.

385
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,790
Get outta here!

386
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,130
I've got more important stuff to do.

387
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,950
I've got no time to fool
around with you guys!

388
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,130
What the..?!

389
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:41,509
Shut up, you ass!!

390
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,590
Do you even know how hard
he worked to fix that?

391
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,970
You know..

392
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,550
Yo, Koyuki.

393
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,950
Isn't that the guitar from before?

394
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,429
You got it fixed, huh?

395
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,890
Lend it to me.

396
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,350
No way.

397
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,310
Stop staring, it's annoying!

398
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,460
Teach him a lesson!

399
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:45,390
Here.

400
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,590
Take this.

401
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,149
Hey!

402
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,890
Hold him.

403
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,620
Stop it there!

404
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,870
Whatcha boys doing?

405
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,870
What's with you?

406
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,670
HEY!

407
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,150
Get away!

408
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,160
He told me everything.

409
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,950
Err...

410
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,210
Ouch!

411
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,250
I know..

412
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:06,870
1..2..3... YAYYY...!

413
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,679
Doesn't sound like he's just started
playing the guitar a few months ago.

414
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,110
He must be practicing so hard.

415
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,020
Saku..

416
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,710
The drums... Wanna play?

417
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,830
Great..

418
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,530
He's got the feeling for it too.

419
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,110
You want those two with BECK?

420
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,149
Yep.

421
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,390
Just as supporting members first.

422
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,310
Saku is okay...
but Koyuki isn't up at our level yet.

423
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:12,529
I just wanna... give them a go.

424
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,090
No way!

425
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,350
If we keep going like this, ...
we might have to disband.

426
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:26,390
Having great musicians doesn't
always guarantee the band's success.

427
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,710
Chemistry is also important.

428
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,100
Is it really okay?...

429
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,200
It's too soon..

430
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,050
You'll make it through.

431
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,019
Let's do it!

432
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,229
After you.

433
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,029
Yeah... After you.

434
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,210
After you.

435
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,070
Come on now.

436
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:12,300
New members of BECK... Koyuki and Saku...
Give 'em your support... Evolution.

437
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,870
Koyuki, stop gazing at the floor!

438
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,330
So terrible!

439
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:35,950
I missed the last train...
Let me crash here, Koyuki.

440
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,469
Cool!

441
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,370
You made this, Maho?

442
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,259
Yeah, it's my dream.

443
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,860
I wanna be a movie director.

444
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,939
I'm sure you can do it... This is so cool!

445
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,030
I'm off to bed now.

446
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:06,260
Lend me a T-shirt.

447
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,980
Will I make it?

448
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,630
I feel that I'm stuck.

449
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,419
Ryusuke told me that...
you put too much effort on the action..

450
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,870
But lacking in the feeling, Koyuki.

451
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:48,290
He said the most important thing is
what you want to express.

452
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,199
You can have that...
It's the pic used by Dying Breed's Eddy.

453
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,280
Eh?

454
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,710
You sure I can have it?

455
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:09,150
Koyuki, the time will come when you
want to express your feelings too.

456
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:16,690
But it's been a long time since I saw
Ryusuke having so much fun.

457
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,030
Umm... Eh?!

458
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:01,269
Koyuki...

459
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,910
Koyuki!

460
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,030
Dying Breed... is coming to Japan!

461
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,670
Yaaaayyyy...

462
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:23,709
You think Ryusuke-kun will
take us to meet Eddy?

463
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,169
No way!

464
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,169
Dying Breed sold millions
now all over the States.

465
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,810
Anyway, is he really friends with them?

466
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:33,569
Ouch!

467
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,399
The new song, "Looking Back"

468
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,390
It's not completely done yet.

469
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,350
The music is pretty good, but...

470
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,369
It won't suit Chiba's vocal?

471
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,989
That's it... That's the problem!

472
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,949
But it's my song, so I'll sing it.

473
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,509
It's in English... So I'll do it.

474
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,089
I've passed the English
Proficiency Test level 2.

475
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:25,350
This song... Can I sing it?

476
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:29,690
Ah, I mean..

477
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,520
It's about Maho, right?

478
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,070
Jesus Christ...!

479
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:16,370
Koyuki-kun!

480
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,549
Hey!

481
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,290
But..is it..?

482
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:30,249
You've got a new vocal, so I'm out?

483
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,509
Idiot!... Our concert
won't be fun without you!

484
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,979
You're our band's greatest front man!

485
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,089
We'd never fire you.

486
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:43,309
Really?... Really!... That's great!

487
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:47,669
<i>TV... ON!... Their major debut
has finally been set.</i>

488
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,009
<i>This video clip you're watching
now is their single "Falling"</i>

489
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,110
<i>which was shot at a studio in New York.
... Eiji!</i>

490
00:50:53,111 --> 00:50:56,909
<i>It was directed by the

491
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,449
<i>And produced by the

492

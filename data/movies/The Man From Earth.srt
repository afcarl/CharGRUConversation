2
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:45,539
Hey, buddy.

3
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,569
You don't waste time, do you?

4
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,273
I try not to.

5
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:50,645
Well, you need help?

6
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,741
Sure.

7
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:57,546
Would you like to tell us

8
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,581
what the hell that was all about?

9
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:00,886
I don't like good-byes.

10
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:03,724
Kind of the point of
a good-bye party, John.

11
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:06,287
Went to a certain amount
of trouble, you know?

12
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,800
Could've at least stayed
a few minutes, huh?

13
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:12,736
Eaten some of the food
we so feverishly prepared?

14
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,295
I apologize, Harry.

15
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:15,896
But why are you moving so quickly?

16
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,067
You only resigned a couple of days ago.

17
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,169
You got the history chair at Stanford.

18
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:21,236
I wish.

19
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,440
Well, taquitos, chicken wings,

20
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:25,346
Roastie-Toasties and beer.

21
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,146
If we'd had more time,

22
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,244
we'd have done something
a little more grandiose.

23
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,016
Candlelight dinner at McDonald's.

24
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,546
Strippers.

25
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,422
Taquitos are fine.

26
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,325
A'right.

27
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:38,123
Art's gonna be along, too.

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,959
He's, uh, talking to a student. Pfft.

29
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,829
Is George taking over for you?

30
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,562
- George or Trimbell.
- Has the dean made up his mind?

31
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:45,661
He hasn't called.

32
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,670
My god!

33
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,138
Wh-What is this?

34
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:49,435
It looks like a Van Gogh,

35
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,908
But I've never seen it before.

36
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:52,342
Is that an original, John?

37
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,676
No, it's just a gift someone gave me.

38
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,681
Still, it's a superb copy.

39
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,649
Contemporaneous, I think,

40
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:00,584
May I take a closer look?

41
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:01,620
Please, yeah.

42
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,449
Yeah, it's the same
stretcher as Van Gogh used.

43
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,052
Yeah, there's writing
on the back in French.

44
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,494
Oh, "to my friend Jacques Borne."

45
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,690
Wonder who that was?

46
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,197
Someone he knew, I guess.

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,892
Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

48
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:18,869
Surely you'll have this
looked at, appraised?

49
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,838
Well, maybe sometime,

50
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:24,137
but I wouldn't really want money for it.

51
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:27,805
That does it.

52
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,710
Put that stuff in the kitchen.

53
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:33,240
No, I'm gonna put it
in the bathroom, John.

54
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,514
Gas is off, electricity's on.

55
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,712
Get comfortable while you can.

56
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,292
The furniture's going this afternoon.

57
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,795
It's been years since I sat on a floor.

58
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,729
Heh. I can't remember her name.

59
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,356
Eh, it's good for the back.

60
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,264
Can we do yoga exercises?

61
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,132
Tantric yoga, we can.

62
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,098
So you're leaving
good old "we teach you."

63
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,166
Rather suddenly, you must admit.

64
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,835
Truth time, John.

65
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:01,436
Is there a problem?

66
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,777
No.

67
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,008
Oh, come on, you know we wanna help.

68
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,211
That's appreciated, but really...

69
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,254
There's no problem.

70
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,846
Well, now I am curious.

71
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,151
Where are you going?

72
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,385
Givin' up tenure...

73
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,392
A decade of professorship,

74
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,826
in line to chain' the department,

75
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:20,729
and you don't know where you're going?

76
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,198
Call it cabin fever.

77
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:24,725
After a while, I get itchy feet.

78
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:25,997
I've done this before.

79
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,131
No, no, no, you're too young
to have done this before.

80
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,438
And he hasn't aged a day in ten years.

81
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,943
Every woman on the faculty

82
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,537
would give anything to have that secret.

83
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:37,172
Is that what they're after, Edith?

84
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,843
Oh, stop, Harry.

85
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,245
Wow, can you pull this?

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,252
What the hell?

87
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:47,587
What do you hunt?

88
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:48,820
Deer, mostly.

89
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,021
Around big bear.

90
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,427
With a bow and arrow?

91
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,158
Most people can't bag a deer

92
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,223
with a rifle and a telescopic sight.

93
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:56,825
Though, good eatin'.

94
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,359
The best wild game.

95
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:59,995
Lives naturally, eats naturally.

96
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,506
Well, it's beautiful.

97
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:06,371
Art.

98
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,672
Ah.

99
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,980
So, can I get an "a" for awesome?

100
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,007
Oh, my gosh.

101
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,787
That was fun.

102
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,221
Hey, John.

103
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,724
You know Linda.
You had her last semester.

104
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,090
Hi. Hey.

105
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,047
She's one of my victims now.
I'm taking her home.

106
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,927
She wanted to come by
and say hello good-bye.

107
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,397
Is Art as tough as I hear?

108
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,798
Oh, archaeology's tough.

109
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:30,825
Dr. Jenkins is a fine teacher.

110
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,837
Oh, that's very politic.

111
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,395
It's very true. Uh-huh.

112
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,908
Something for you to
read on the road, pal.

113
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,843
"Shadows of the cave:
parallels to early man."

114
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,277
M. Jenkins.

115
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:42,473
Publish or perish.

116
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,606
I'd rather read

117
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,741
than write another one.

118
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,648
Thank you.

119
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,912
Hi.

120
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,215
Oh, everybody, this is Linda.

121
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:52,485
Linda, this is everybody.

122
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,048
Linda. Hi.

123
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,321
So.

124
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:58,852
Where you going, John,
like we give a damn?

125
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,057
We've already covered that.

126
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,464
John's got itchy feet.

127
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,799
There are over-the-counter
remedies for that, John.

128
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:09,070
So there is a problem.

129
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,871
No.

130
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:13,207
I just like to move on now and then.

131
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,575
It's a personal thing.

132
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,072
Well, not to pry.

133
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,491
I'm sorry I don't
have more to offer you.

134
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,052
Got conversation, some
seats for your behinds,

135
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,120
And, uh...

136
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,392
Is he ducking out on us again?

137
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,499
...I do have this.

138
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,136
Oh ho ho! Johnny Walker green!

139
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,975
Didn't even
know they made it in green.

140
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,413
What do they pay you?

141
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,416
Nothing is too good for my friends.

142
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,420
But I'm sorry,
we are down to plastic cups now.

143
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,422
That's a sacrilege I'll tolerate.

144
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,083
I will do the honors.

145
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:00,751
Oh, come to papa.

146
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:03,784
Ooh! Here, cups, cups.

147
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:04,851
There we go.

148
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:05,989
Step on in here.

149
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,053
There ya go...

150
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,567
One for the birthday boy...
Excuse me. Art?

151
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,659
No, not for me.

152
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,066
Oh, no, I don't drink.

153
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,162
We're not
gonna card you, darling.

154
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,197
All right, here, join
the circle at least.

155
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,905
Well, to long life and good fortune.

156
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,469
To our esteemed friend

157
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,414
and colleague, John Oldman.

158
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,348
May he find undeserved bliss

159
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,579
wherever he goes.

160
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:28,586
Hear, hear.

161
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,485
Skol. Na zdorovye.

162
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,387
One off the top, John.

163
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,225
Mm! Oh, that's good.

164
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,424
Excuse me.

165
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:46,035
John, we're all sorry to see you go.

166
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,128
Truly.

167
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,700
Okay. Now we're done with that,

168
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,778
what do we do for the
rest of the afternoon?

169
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,575
Anyone got a good topic?

170
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:57,377
Like this, maybe? Heh.

171
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,405
What is that?

172
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,112
It's a burin off a parrot beak.

173
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:02,950
Inclined chisel point...

174
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,988
Probably early Magdalenian.

175
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,357
<i>- May I see that?</i>
- Sure.

176
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,894
Yes indeed, that's what it is.

177
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,294
What's a burin?

178
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,961
A burin is a flint tool

179
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,596
for grooving wood and
bone, antlers especially,

180
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,107
to make spear and harpoon points.

181
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:26,167
Magdalenians weren't
noted for flint work,

182
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,940
so this is a very nice specimen.

183
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,448
Okay, what's a Magdalenian?

184
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:31,881
A later Cro-Magnon,

185
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,179
without gettin' technical.

186
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,379
It's the final culture
of the upper Paleolithic.

187
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,184
If stones could speak, eh, Art?

188
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,918
So where'd you get that, John?

189
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,517
Believe it or not, from a thrift shop.
A quarter.

190
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,084
You lucky dog!

191
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:46,426
I gotta go digging
for this kind of stuff.

192
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:47,624
Can I, uh?

193
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,688
Yeah.

194
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,230
Huh.

195
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,937
Maybe...

196
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,479
I'm glad you did this.

197
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:04,344
Did what? You mean come over?

198
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,044
Maybe?

199
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,379
Definitely.

200
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,749
Gee, thanks.

201
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:10,084
Well, so are we.

202
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:11,486
So are we.

203
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,683
We couldn't let you just run off.

204
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,885
Thanks.

205
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:18,657
John, what is up, huh?

206
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,231
Are you on America's most wanted?

207
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,357
We won't turn you in.

208
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,797
Yeah, come on, out with it.

209
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:23,800
You're among friends.

210
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,063
Snoopy friends.

211
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:26,070
Forget it.

212
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,763
You are creating the mystery here.

213
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,104
Obviously, you have something
you'd like to say. Say it!

214
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,369
Well, maybe I...

215
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:35,741
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

216
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,805
Harry, stop.

217
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,184
There is something I'm
tempted to tell you, I think.

218
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,814
I've never done this before,
and I wonder how it'll pan out.

219
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:50,291
I wonder if I could ask
you a silly question.

220
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,296
John, we're teachers.

221
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,264
We answer silly questions all the time.

222
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:54,322
Hey!

223
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,062
What if a man from the upper Paleolithic

224
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,900
survived until the present day?

225
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:01,633
What do you mean, survived?

226
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:02,935
Never died?

227
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,067
Yes. What would he be like?

228
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,576
Well, I know some guys.

229
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,442
You ever been to the Ozarks?

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,243
It's an interesting idea.

231
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,773
What, are you working on
a science fiction story?

232
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,046
Say I am. What would he be like?

233
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,349
Pretty tired.

234
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,985
Well, seriously,

235
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,219
As Art's book title suggests,

236
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,387
he might be like any of us.

237
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,657
Dan. A caveman?

238
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,527
Well, there's no anatomical difference

239
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,295
between, say, a Cro-Magnon and us.

240
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,768
Except that as a rule,
we've grown taller.

241
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:34,101
What's the selective
advantage of height?

242
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,902
Better to see predators
in tall grass, my dear.

243
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:39,170
Actually, tall and skinny

244
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:42,110
radiates heat more
effectively in warmer climates.

245
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,374
And as for Neanderthals,

246
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,143
I mean, we've all seen apish people.

247
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:46,377
That strain's still with us.

248
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,511
But he'd be a caveman.

249
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,519
No, he wouldn't.

250
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,577
John's hypothetical man

251
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,385
would have lived
through 140 centuries...

252
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:53,789
Yeah, roughly.

253
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,191
...and changed with every one of them.

254
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,526
I mean, assuming normal intelligence.

255
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:01,065
Well, we think men of
the upper Paleolithic

256
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,930
were as intelligent as we are.

257
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,696
They just didn't know as much.

258
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:07,738
John's man would have
learned as the race learned.

259
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,900
In fact, if he had an inquiring mind,

260
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:14,002
his knowledge might be astonishing.

261
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,309
If you do write that,
let me have a look at it.

262
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,543
I'm sure you'll make some
anthropological boners.

263
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:19,641
It's a deal.

264
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:21,549
What would keep him alive?

265
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,417
What does the biologist say?

266
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,047
Cigarettes.

267
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,920
And ice cream.

268
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,017
All right, all right, I'll play.

269
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:32,790
All right, um, in science fiction terms,

270
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,458
I would say...

271
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:39,800
Perfect regeneration
of the body's cells,

272
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,931
especially in the vital organs.

273
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,838
Actually, the human
body appears designed

274
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,934
to live about 190 years.

275
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:49,811
Most of us just die of slow poisoning.

276
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,338
Maybe he did something right,

277
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,682
something everybody else
in history had done wrong.

278
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,084
What, like eat the food,

279
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,145
drink the water, and breathe the air?

280
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,124
Prior to modern times,

281
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,989
those were pristine.

282
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:06,487
We've extended our lifespan
in a world that's, uh...

283
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:08,396
not fit to live in.

284
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,900
You know, it could happen.

285
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,233
The pancreas turns over
cells every 24 hours,

286
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,862
the stomach lining in three days,

287
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,463
the entire body in seven years,

288
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:16,997
but the process falters.

289
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,872
Waste accumulates, eventually
proves fatal to function.

290
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,539
Now if a quirk in his immune system

291
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:24,309
led to perfect detox,

292
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:26,317
perfect renewal, then yeah.

293
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:28,546
He could duck decay.

294
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,850
Mm, that's a secret
we'd all love to have.

295
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,823
Would you really want to do that?

296
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,724
Live 14,000 years?

297
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,557
Well, if I could stay
healthy and I didn't age,

298
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,722
I mean, why not?

299
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,958
Yeah. What a chance to learn.

300
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,831
Is anyone hungry?

301
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,737
You know, the more I think
about it, yeah, it's possible.

302
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:49,330
Anything is possible, right?

303
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:52,639
After all, one century's magic,
another century's science.

304
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,804
They thought Columbus
was a nut job, right?

305
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:55,870
Pasteur, Copernicus?

306
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,574
Aristarchus long before that.

307
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,673
Right.

308
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,980
I had a chance to sail with Columbus,

309
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,385
Only I'm not the adventurous type.

310
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,356
I was pretty sure the Earth was round,

311
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:09,121
but at that point, I still thought

312
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,890
he might fall off an edge someplace...

313
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,206
Look around, John.

314
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,607
We just did.

315
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,010
I suppose there's a
joke in there somewhere,

316
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,308
but I don't get it.

317
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:31,212
There's nothing to get.

318
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,012
What are we talking about?

319
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,983
We were just talking about a caveman

320
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,386
who survives until the present time.

321
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,754
As you said, what a chance to learn,

322
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:41,223
once I learned to learn.

323
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,419
Did you start the whiskey
before we got here?

324
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,400
Pretend it's science fiction.

325
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,164
Figure it out.

326
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:56,731
Okay, a...
very old Cro-Magnon

327
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,333
living until the present.

328
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,811
Oh!

329
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,075
What?

330
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,053
John just confided that
he's 14,000 years old.

331
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,684
Oh, John, you don't look a day over 900.

332
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:15,920
Okay, okay.

333
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:17,774
All right, Spock, I'll
play your little game.

334
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,424
What do you want? What's the punch line?

335
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:23,126
Every ten years or so, when people start

336
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,896
to notice I don't age, I move on.

337
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:29,905
That's very good,
that's very quick, John.

338
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,341
I wanna read that
story when you're done.

339
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,843
You want more?

340
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,777
By all means. This is great.

341
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:36,803
All right, now...

342
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,510
So you think that you are a...

343
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,610
A, uh, Cro-Magnon.

344
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,211
Well, I didn't learn it in school.

345
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:44,915
That's my best guess,

346
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:49,460
based on archaeological data,
maps, anthropological research.

347
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:50,824
Since Mesopotamia,

348
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:54,057
I've got the last...
4,000 years straight.

349
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:57,226
You're ahead of most
people, so please, go on.

350
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:58,826
Well, you know the background stuff,

351
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,269
so I'll make it brief.

352
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,738
In what I call my first lifetime,

353
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:04,469
I aged to about 35...

354
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:06,101
what you see.

355
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:08,304
I ended up leading my group.

356
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,177
They saw me as magical.

357
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,207
I didn't even have to fight for it.

358
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:16,151
Then fear came, and they chased me away.

359
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:17,677
They thought that I was

360
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:20,054
stealing their lives away to stay young.

361
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:22,389
The prehistoric origin
of the vampire myth.

362
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:23,325
That is good!

363
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,384
First thousand years,

364
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,521
I didn't know up from sideways.

365
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:29,032
How do you know the
first thousand years?

366
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,590
An informed guess, based on what

367
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,102
I've learned in my memories.

368
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,196
Most people can scarcely
remember their childhood,

369
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,298
but you have memories of that time?

370
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,899
Like yours, selective.

371
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:41,309
You know, the high points,
the low points, traumas.

372
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:43,041
They stick in the mind forever.

373
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:47,016
Put down at 3 or 35,
you still feel a twinge.

374
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,818
Go on.

375
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,881
I kept getting chased
because I wouldn't die,

376
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,326
so I got the hang of
joining new groups I found.

377
00:14:57,362 --> 00:15:00,729
I also got the idea of
periodically moving on.

378
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:03,256
We were semi-nomadic, of course,

379
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:06,303
following the weather
and the game we hunted.

380
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,271
The first 2,000 years were cold.

381
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,933
We learned it was warmer
at lower elevations.

382
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,569
Late glacial period, I assume.

383
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,171
What was the terrain like?

384
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:19,308
Mountainous.

385
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,284
Vast plains to the west.

386
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:25,388
West - something you learned in school.

387
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:27,983
Towards the setting sun.

388
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,391
I suspect I saw the British isles

389
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,726
from what is now the French coast.

390
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,389
Huge mountains...

391
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,162
on the other side of
an enormous deep valley

392
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,102
that was shadowed by the setting sun.

393
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,002
This is before they were separated

394
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,633
from the continent by rising
seas, as glaciers melted.

395
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,242
That happened?

396
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,438
Yes, the end of the Pleistocene.

397
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:50,504
So far, what he says fits.

398
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,573
Oh, yeah, into any textbook.

399
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,551
And that's where I found it.

400
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:56,484
How can I have knowledgeable recall

401
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,352
if I didn't have knowledge?

402
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:00,357
It's all retrospective.

403
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,825
All I can do is
integrate my recollections

404
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,590
with modern findings.

405
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:07,324
Caveman, you gonna hit me
over the head with a club

406
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,992
and drag me into the bedroom?

407
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,659
You'd be more fun conscious.

408
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:11,600
Oh, John.

409
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:12,897
Let me get this straight.

410
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,802
We're not talking about reincarnation.

411
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,670
You're not saying that you remember

412
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,107
whatever the hell it would be,

413
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:19,473
200 separate lifetimes, dying

414
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,911
and being born again and yada yada?

415
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,413
One lifetime.

416
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:25,947
Some lifetime.

417
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,281
Wow.

418
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:29,786
Maybe there is something
to this reincarnation thing.

419
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,083
You're supposed to come back

420
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:32,714
again and again, learn and learn,

421
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,315
and somehow, John, you just managed

422
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,882
to bypass all the other bodies.

423
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:38,191
Well, what's the point?

424
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:43,029
What about oceans?

425
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,399
Didn't see them till much later.

426
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:47,768
So how would you know
an ocean from a lake?

427
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,603
Big waves - something else.

428
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,836
I can only surmise in retrospect.

429
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,901
Were you curious about
where it all came from?

430
00:16:55,413 --> 00:16:57,574
We would look up at the sky and wonder.

431
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,776
"There's gotta be
some big guys up there.

432
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,479
What else made all this down here?"

433
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,043
At first I thought

434
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,681
there was something wrong with me -

435
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:08,282
maybe I was a bad guy for not dying.

436
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,691
Then I began to wonder if I was cursed

437
00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:14,959
or perhaps blessed.

438
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:18,695
Then I thought maybe I had a mission.

439
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,465
Do you still think you do?

440
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:22,234
God works in mysterious ways.

441
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:25,606
I think I just happened.

442
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:34,476
Wow.

443
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,577
Hello?

444
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,486
Yes, Ellie?

445
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,354
What's wrong?

446
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:41,483
Sandy?

447
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:42,618
Coming.

448
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,861
Yeah?

449
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,626
Do we have Ellie's midterm here?

450
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,091
Yeah, sorry.

451
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,637
I picked it up with the periodicals.

452
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,934
Got it.

453
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,702
No, you're worried about your parents?

454
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:59,141
Don't... don't worry.

455
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,507
You passed, C+.

456
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,877
Take care of yourself.

457
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,278
Good kid.

458
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,180
What does pre-med need with history?

459
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,548
Got it.

460
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:08,882
Thank you.

461
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,315
Sorry, guys.

462
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,051
John, please continue.

463
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:16,353
Come on, I thought we
were done with that.

464
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:17,986
No! Let's go on with it.

465
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,359
It's interesting.

466
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:22,262
Besides, I think he's making
a certain amount of sense.

467
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,860
Like Hegel.
Logic from absurd premises.

468
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,200
That Van Gogh?

469
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,398
He gave it to me.

470
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:31,169
I was, uh, Jacques Bourne at the time,

471
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,403
A pig farmer.

472
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:33,774
A pig farmer?

473
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,104
I like to work with my hands.

474
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:39,274
He would come out to the place, paint.

475
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,376
We talked about capturing nature in art.

476
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,546
Turner, Cezanne, Pissarro.

477
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:45,522
Oh, the Nolde landscapes.

478
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,387
Not in Van Gogh's time.

479
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:48,982
He would have loved them, though.

480
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:49,994
Yes.

481
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,721
Well, I don't understand

482
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:53,957
why you can't remember
where you're from.

483
00:18:53,998
